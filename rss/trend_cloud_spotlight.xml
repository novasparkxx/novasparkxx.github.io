        In the world of technology, there have been several exciting developments recently. Azure OpenAI Service has introduced new deployment and cost management solutions, allowing for more efficient AI deployments. This includes the addition of self-service Provisioned, which further enhances the capabilities of the service. Meanwhile, Google Cloud is offering top AI courses for those looking to expand their knowledge during the summer. These courses provide an opportunity to learn and explore the potential of AI with the support of Google's cloud platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amazon has also made an announcement regarding their storage class support on Amazon EMR. They have introduced Amazon S3 Express One Zone storage class, which provides users with more options and flexibility when it comes to storing their data. Additionally, Amazon EC2 On-Demand Capacity Reservations now come with new capabilities such as the ability to split, move, and modify additional attributes. This allows for better management and optimization of resources on the EC2 platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google has launched the new Google Distributed Cloud initiative, which focuses on delivering sovereign cloud solutions. This initiative aims to provide secure and reliable cloud services that meet the specific requirements of different regions and countries. It enables organizations to have greater control over their data and ensures compliance with local regulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the realm of API development, there has been a shift from gRPC to RESTful APIs. This transition allows for the exposure of gRPC services to the rest of the world, making it easier for developers to integrate and interact with these services. This opens up new possibilities for building scalable and interoperable applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assured Workloads, a service offered by Google, has introduced new features that enable updates and new control packages. This allows organizations to have more flexibility and control over their workloads, ensuring that they meet the necessary security and compliance requirements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, Looker, a data analytics platform, has opened its semantic layer through a new SQL Interface. This interface provides users with a more intuitive and user-friendly way to interact with their data. Additionally, Looker has also introduced connectors for Tableau and other platforms, making it easier to integrate and visualize data across different tools.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These new tools, products, and projects demonstrate the continuous innovation and advancements happening in the technology industry. They provide users with enhanced capabilities, improved efficiency, and greater control over their data and workloads.

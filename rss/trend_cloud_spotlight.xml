In a move to enhance user experience, Amazon Connect has added support for nine additional languages, improving forecasting, capacity planning, and scheduling functionalities. Additionally, Amazon CloudFront has expanded its access logs capabilities by supporting new log formats and destinations. On the analytics front, Amazon QuickSight now offers fine-grained permissions for IAM Identity Center users, enhancing security and control over data access.

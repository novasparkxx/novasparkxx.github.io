        In the world of technology, there have been several notable developments. Firstly, it has been announced that support for log alert rules that utilize cross-workspace queries with resource names or qualified name identifiers will be retired on May 31, 2024. This change indicates a shift in the approach to log alert rules and may require users to adapt their strategies accordingly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, Azure Virtual Network Manager security admin rule has become generally available in 30 regions. This advancement in network security management allows for more efficient and effective administration of virtual networks across a wide range of locations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, there is a new guide available on consuming Cloud Storage objects on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) using the Kubernetes API. This guide, titled "Part I," provides valuable insights and instructions on how to leverage the Kubernetes API to access and utilize Cloud Storage objects within the GKE environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of Azure services, a private preview has been announced for Azure Site Recovery support for Azure Trusted Launch VMs running on Windows OS. This feature aims to enhance the security and reliability of virtual machines by providing support for Azure Trusted Launch, a technology that ensures the integrity of the boot process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, it has been revealed that Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL now supports Trusted Language Extensions such as croaring-rs and num-bigint crate. This update allows PostgreSQL users on Amazon RDS to leverage these extensions, providing them with additional functionality and capabilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, there is no specific information provided in the given news.

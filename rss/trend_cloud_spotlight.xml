        In the world today, there have been several notable developments. Firstly, Microsoft has announced a Private Preview for Azure Site Recovery, which now supports Azure Trusted Launch VMs running on the Windows operating system. This new feature enhances the security and reliability of virtual machines on the Azure platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other news, Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL has introduced support for Trusted Language Extensions, specifically the croaring-rs and num-bigint crate. This update allows developers to leverage these extensions when working with PostgreSQL databases, enabling them to enhance performance and functionality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, there is also news of a retirement. Support for log alert rules that utilize cross-workspace queries with resource names or qualified name identifiers will be discontinued on 31 May 2024. Users are advised to make necessary adjustments to their log alert configurations before this date to ensure uninterrupted monitoring and alerting capabilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, Azure Virtual Network Manager has made its security admin rule generally available in 30 regions. This tool enables administrators to manage and enforce security policies within virtual networks, enhancing network security and control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, the aforementioned Azure Virtual Network Manager security admin rule is a significant addition. Its availability in 30 regions provides users with a robust solution for managing network security across various Azure environments. Additionally, the support for Trusted Language Extensions in Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL opens up new possibilities for developers to optimize their database operations. These developments reflect the continuous efforts of technology companies to enhance security, performance, and functionality in their respective platforms.

        Dear friend,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope this message finds you well. I have some news to share with you regarding the retirement of Azure Data Catalog. As of 15 May 2024, Azure Data Catalog will be officially retired. This decision has been made by the Azure team, and it will have an impact on users and organizations utilizing this service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Azure Data Catalog has been a valuable tool for data professionals, providing a centralized repository to discover, understand, and manage data assets. It has helped businesses in organizing and governing their data, enabling efficient data exploration and collaboration. However, with evolving technologies and changing market demands, the Azure team has decided to retire this service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This retirement notice means that after 15 May 2024, Azure Data Catalog will no longer be available for use. Users will no longer be able to create new catalogs or add new assets to existing catalogs. However, existing catalogs and assets will remain accessible until the retirement date. It is important for users and organizations relying on Azure Data Catalog to plan and prepare for this transition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In light of this retirement, it is crucial to explore alternative solutions and tools that can fulfill the data cataloging and management needs. Microsoft offers various other services and products that can assist in this regard. Azure Purview, for example, is a powerful data governance service that provides a unified and holistic view of your data estate. It enables discovery, classification, and management of data assets across various sources, both on-premises and in the cloud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, there are several third-party data cataloging tools available in the market that can be considered as alternatives. These tools offer similar functionalities and can help in organizing and governing data assets effectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the retirement date approaches, it is advisable to evaluate the impact on your organization's data management processes and explore the available options. Microsoft and other vendors are continuously innovating and introducing new tools, products, and projects to address the evolving needs of data management. Stay updated with the latest developments in this field to ensure a smooth transition and efficient data governance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have any further questions or need assistance in navigating this transition, feel free to reach out. I'm here to support you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take care and stay safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warm regards,&lt;br&gt;[Your Name]

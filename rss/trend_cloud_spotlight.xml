        In recent developments within the tech world, Amazon has made significant strides in enhancing its suite of services. Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) has introduced TLS version support for outgoing messages, bolstering security for email communications. Meanwhile, Anthropic has upgraded its AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which is now available, alongside the upcoming Claude 3.5 Haiku in the public beta of Amazon Bedrock. AWS Lambda has also expanded its capabilities by allowing the use of custom serializers with Java runtimes, offering developers greater flexibility. In the realm of customer engagement, Amazon Connect has launched iOS and Android Chat SDKs, enabling seamless in-app chat experiences. Additionally, AWS Deadline Cloud has improved its functionality by sending job, step, and task-related events, while Amazon RDS for Oracle has added support for Oracle Application Express (APEX) Version 24.1. Security enhancements continue with the AWS WAF Bot and Fraud Control RuleGroup, now available in six more AWS regions. Furthermore, Amazon Redshift Serverless has been made accessible in the AWS GovCloud (US) regions, and AWS IAM Identity Center has simplified interactions with AWS services through a single identity context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;### New Tools, Products, and Projects:&lt;br&gt;1. **Amazon SES**: Now supports TLS version for outgoing messages, enhancing email security.&lt;br&gt;2. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Upgraded AI model from Anthropic, now available.&lt;br&gt;3. **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: Upcoming AI model in public beta on Amazon Bedrock.&lt;br&gt;4. **AWS Lambda**: Custom serializer support for Java runtimes introduced.&lt;br&gt;5. **Amazon Connect**: Launch of iOS and Android Chat SDKs for in-app chat experiences.&lt;br&gt;6. **AWS Deadline Cloud**: New feature to send job, step, and task-related events.&lt;br&gt;7. **Amazon RDS for Oracle**: Now supports Oracle Application Express (APEX) Version 24.1.&lt;br&gt;8. **AWS WAF Bot and Fraud Control RuleGroup**: Expanded availability in six additional AWS regions.&lt;br&gt;9. **Amazon Redshift Serverless**: Now available in AWS GovCloud (US) regions.&lt;br&gt;10. **AWS IAM Identity Center**: Simplified calls to AWS services with a single identity context.

This development allows for easier access and integration with other platforms such as Tableau.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google has launched the Distributed Cloud initiative, which aims to deliver sovereign cloud solutions. This initiative ensures that cloud services are compliant with local regulations and data sovereignty requirements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, Assured Workloads has introduced new features that enable updates and new control packages. This allows users to stay up to date with the latest security measures and control options for their workloads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, these recent developments in the tech world offer exciting opportunities for AI deployments, learning, API integration, and cloud solutions.

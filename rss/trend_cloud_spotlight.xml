        In recent developments within the tech world, Amazon has expanded its cloud services significantly across various regions. The Amazon Neptune Database is now accessible in both the Asia Pacific (Jakarta) and Europe (Spain) regions, enhancing its global reach and availability for users. Additionally, Amazon Redshift Serverless has increased its base capacity to 1024 Redshift Processing Units, allowing for more robust data processing capabilities. The platform has also introduced enhanced VPC routing for warehouses, facilitating zero-ETL integration, which streamlines data workflows. For those looking to optimize costs, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) users can benefit from Hyperdisk Storage Pools, which promise to reduce block storage expenses. Furthermore, Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server has launched in three additional AWS regions, and Amazon ECS now supports AWS Fargate for Graviton-based Spot computing, providing more flexible and cost-effective computing options. In a move towards improved security, Amazon Cognito user pools have added email as a multi-factor authentication option. Lastly, an innovative online shopping demo experience has been introduced, showcasing the capabilities of Gemini and RAG technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;### New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;1. **Amazon Neptune Database** - Now available in Asia Pacific (Jakarta) and Europe (Spain) regions.&lt;br&gt;2. **Amazon Redshift Serverless** - Supports a higher base capacity of 1024 Redshift Processing Units.&lt;br&gt;3. **Enhanced VPC Routing for Amazon Redshift** - Facilitates zero-ETL integration for data warehouses.&lt;br&gt;4. **Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server** - Launched in three additional AWS regions.&lt;br&gt;5. **Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate** - Now supports Graviton-based Spot computing.&lt;br&gt;6. **Hyperdisk Storage Pools** - A cost-saving solution for GKE block storage.&lt;br&gt;7. **Amazon Cognito** - Offers email as a multi-factor authentication option.&lt;br&gt;8. **Online Shopping Demo Experience** - Showcasing Gemini and RAG technologies.

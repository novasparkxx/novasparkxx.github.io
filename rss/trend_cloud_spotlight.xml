        In the world of technology, Google Cloud is making significant advancements in the field of artificial intelligence. With the integration of BigQuery and Vertex AI, the power of generative AI is being unleashed. This collaboration between the two platforms allows for the development of innovative applications that harness the capabilities of AI. Additionally, Google Cloud databases are now equipped with new features, enabling them to support gen AI apps more effectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other news, a major change is on the horizon for the Cloud Services (classic) deployment model. It has been announced that this model will be retired on August 31, 2024. This decision reflects the continuous evolution of cloud services and the need to adapt to newer, more efficient deployment models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, Google Cloud has expanded the availability of encryption at host for Premium SSD v2 and Ultra Disks. This enhancement ensures that data stored in these disks remains secure by encrypting it at the host level. This feature is now accessible in more regions, providing users with increased data protection options.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, a new project is being introduced in the form of a public preview. Internet inbound for Network Virtual Appliances in Virtual WAN Hubs is now available for testing. This project aims to enhance the functionality of Network Virtual Appliances by enabling internet inbound connectivity. This development opens up new possibilities for networking and connectivity within virtual environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, Google Cloud's integration of BigQuery and Vertex AI stands out as a major advancement. This collaboration allows developers to tap into the power of generative AI, enabling the creation of innovative applications. Additionally, the expansion of encryption at host for Premium SSD v2 and Ultra Disks in more regions showcases Google Cloud's commitment to data security. Lastly, the introduction of internet inbound for Network Virtual Appliances in Virtual WAN Hubs in the public preview stage highlights Google Cloud's continuous efforts to enhance networking capabilities within virtual environments.

        In June 2024, AWS Training and Certification announced new courses and certification updates. These updates aim to provide professionals with the latest knowledge and skills in cloud computing. Additionally, Google has been working to improve rural healthcare cybersecurity through its Cloud CISO Perspectives initiative. This program focuses on enhancing the security measures in rural healthcare facilities, ensuring the protection of sensitive patient data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the world of technology, AWS introduced the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model in Amazon Bedrock. This model, developed by Anthropic, is an advanced version of the previous Claude 3 Opus. It offers increased intelligence while being more cost-effective, with only one-fifth of the original model's price. This development showcases the continuous efforts to enhance artificial intelligence capabilities and make them more accessible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, AWS users can now create custom metrics for Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL and AlloyDB using Logs Explorer. This feature allows users to monitor and analyze specific metrics tailored to their database needs, providing valuable insights for optimization and troubleshooting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, these updates and developments in the tech industry highlight the ongoing progress in cloud computing, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. The introduction of new tools and features demonstrates the commitment to innovation and improving user experiences in these fields.

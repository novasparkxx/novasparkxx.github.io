        In the world of technology, several updates and announcements have been made recently. Amazon EC2 has introduced a new feature that allows status checks to support the reachability health of attached EBS volumes. This enhancement will provide users with better insights into the health and performance of their EC2 instances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AWS Training and Certification has also introduced new courses and certification updates in August 2024. This initiative aims to keep professionals up-to-date with the latest advancements in AWS technologies and ensure they have the necessary skills to excel in their roles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to hosting AI models, users now have the option to choose between self-hosted GKE and managed Vertex AI. This decision depends on individual preferences and requirements. Both options offer unique benefits and can enhance the AI capabilities of businesses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Azure, on the other hand, has introduced new tools to boost AI capabilities. The Phi model, streamlined RAG, and custom generative AI models are designed to enhance the performance and efficiency of AI systems on the Azure platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of infrastructure, Amazon EC2 has expanded its availability by making C6gd and R6gd instances available in the AWS Europe (Spain) region. This expansion will provide users in that region with more options and flexibility when it comes to choosing their EC2 instances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AWS has also announced a streamlined Federated and SSO sign-in process for the AWS Console Mobile App. This improvement will simplify the authentication process for users, making it more convenient and secure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, CloudFormation has introduced enhancements to resource discovery and template review in the IaC Generator. These updates will make it easier for users to manage and review their infrastructure-as-code templates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other news, AWS has provided a comprehensive overview of recent developments, including updates on S3 conditional writes, AWS Lambda, and JAWS Pankration, among others. This summary aims to keep users informed about the latest advancements in the AWS ecosystem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, GKE users can now maximize their LLM (Low Latency Mode) serving throughput for GPUs with a practical guide provided by Google. This guide offers insights and best practices to optimize GPU performance on GKE, enabling users to make the most of their AI workloads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, these updates and announcements highlight the continuous efforts of technology companies to improve their services and provide users with enhanced tools and capabilities.

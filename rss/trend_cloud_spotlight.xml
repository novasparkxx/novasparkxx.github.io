        In the world of technology, Pivotal Founder Rob Mee has embarked on a new venture that aims to revolutionize the way ancient mainframes are brought into the cloud. His startup is utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to accomplish this feat, providing a much-needed upgrade to outdated systems. With the help of AI, these mainframes can now seamlessly integrate with modern cloud infrastructure, offering enhanced performance and scalability. This development is set to transform the way businesses operate and manage their data, ensuring a smoother transition to the cloud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other news, a new feature called "Application consistent restore points" has been made generally available.

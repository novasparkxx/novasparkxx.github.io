        In the world of technology, Google Cloud and SAP have joined forces to forge a path to enduring business innovation in the AI era. This collaboration aims to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to drive growth and efficiency in businesses. Additionally, Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server now offers long-term backup retention, providing users with enhanced data protection and peace of mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other news, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has introduced several new tools and projects. One of them is the Amazon EC2 U7i instance, which offers improved performance and scalability for cloud computing. Another noteworthy development is the Bedrock Converse API, which enables seamless communication and integration between different software applications. Furthermore, AWS celebrated World IPv6 Day, highlighting the importance of adopting IPv6 for a more connected and secure internet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft Azure introduces the use of Gateway Load Balancer and Palo Alto Firewall for centralized deep inspection of network traffic. This integration enhances network security by enabling comprehensive monitoring and analysis of data flows. Additionally, Azure Cosmos DB now supports multi-select delete in Data Explorer, providing users with a more efficient and streamlined data management experience. Moreover, Azure Synapse Link users can now benefit from continuous backup for their Cosmos DB accounts, ensuring data availability and resilience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the realm of cybersecurity, Amazon Web Services offers a deployment guide for their WAF (Web Application Firewall), focusing on the utilization of Centralized Logging with OpenSearch Light Engine. This guide aims to help organizations reduce the cost of monitoring Amazon WAF logs while maintaining effective security measures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, a new tool called Privileged Access Manager has been introduced, allowing businesses to transition from always-on privileges to on-demand access. This tool enhances security by providing controlled and monitored access to privileged accounts, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Additionally, Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB now supports Mongo Ver 7.0, offering users the latest features and capabilities for their MongoDB databases. Furthermore, Azure Database for PostgreSQL introduces online migration in its migration service, simplifying the process of migrating PostgreSQL databases to the Azure platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, these advancements in technology and cybersecurity demonstrate the ongoing efforts to drive innovation, enhance data protection, and improve the efficiency of various cloud-based services.

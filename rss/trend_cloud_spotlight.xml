        In the world of technology, some exciting developments have taken place. Azure Monitor, a managed service for Prometheus, has introduced support for TLS and mTLS based scraping. This enhancement ensures secure and reliable data collection from Prometheus instances. Additionally, Azure has announced a new offering of free data transfer out to the internet when leaving their platform. This move aims to provide cost savings and flexibility for users. On the other hand, Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server has expanded its support to include X2iedn and R5b instances. This update allows users to leverage these powerful instances for their SQL Server workloads, enhancing performance and scalability. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, there have been several notable advancements. One such development is the introduction of Azure Monitor's support for TLS and mTLS based scraping. This feature enables users to securely collect data from Prometheus instances, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of their monitoring data. Additionally, Azure's offering of free data transfer out to the internet provides users with more flexibility and cost savings when transferring data from Azure to external destinations. This can be particularly beneficial for organizations with high data transfer requirements. Lastly, Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server's support for X2iedn and R5b instances opens up new possibilities for users seeking improved performance and scalability for their SQL Server workloads. These instances offer enhanced computational power and storage capabilities, enabling users to handle larger workloads and achieve better overall performance. These advancements in technology continue to push the boundaries of what is possible and empower users with more efficient and secure solutions.

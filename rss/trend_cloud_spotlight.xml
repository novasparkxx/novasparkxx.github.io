        In recent developments within the tech industry, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has expanded its global footprint by making the AWS Directory Service available in the Asia Pacific (Malaysia) Region. This move is expected to enhance cloud service accessibility and support for businesses operating in the region. Additionally, AWS Control Tower has introduced a new feature that allows users to resolve drift for optional controls, enhancing governance and compliance capabilities for multi-account environments. In another significant update, AWS Client VPN has added support for the latest Ubuntu operating system versions, specifically 22.04 LTS and 24.04 LTS, ensuring that users can maintain secure connections with the most up-to-date software. Furthermore, AWS has simplified the deployment of elastic bastion hosts through Cloud Foundations, enabling users to manage secure sessions and port forwarding with just one click, thereby streamlining operations and enhancing security compliance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;### New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;1. **AWS Directory Service** - Now available in the Asia Pacific (Malaysia) Region, facilitating easier cloud service access.&lt;br&gt;2. **AWS Control Tower** - New feature for resolving drift for optional controls, improving governance and compliance.&lt;br&gt;3. **AWS Client VPN** - Updated to support Ubuntu OS versions 22.04 LTS and 24.04 LTS for enhanced security.&lt;br&gt;4. **Cloud Foundations** - One-click deployment of elastic bastion hosts for secure session management and port forwarding.

        In the world of technology, there have been some significant developments recently. One of the major updates is the availability of Azure Virtual Network Manager security admin rule in all public regions. This new feature ensures enhanced security and administration for virtual networks on the Azure platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another noteworthy development is the support for Oracle Application Express (APEX) version 23.2 in Amazon RDS for Oracle. This integration allows users to leverage the capabilities of APEX within their Oracle databases hosted on Amazon RDS, opening up new possibilities for application development and management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, Amazon Route 53 now offers the ability to configure profiles with multiple VPCs and AWS accounts, enabling unified DNS management. This feature simplifies the process of managing DNS settings across different environments and accounts, providing greater flexibility and control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other news, Amazon has introduced several new tools and projects. One of them is the Verified Peering Provider program, which offers a straightforward alternative to Direct Peering. This program aims to streamline the peering process and ensure reliable connectivity between networks, making it easier for organizations to establish and maintain peering relationships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These recent developments in the technology landscape demonstrate the continuous efforts to improve security, efficiency, and connectivity in the digital world. With the availability of Azure Virtual Network Manager security admin rule, support for Oracle APEX in Amazon RDS, and the introduction of the Verified Peering Provider program, users now have access to enhanced features and simplified solutions for their networking and database needs.

        In the world of technology, there have been several noteworthy developments. Firstly, Azure has introduced a Private Preview of Azure Site Recovery support specifically designed for Azure Trusted Launch VMs running on the Windows operating system. This new feature aims to enhance the security and reliability of virtual machines by providing trusted launch capabilities. Additionally, a significant change is on the horizon as support for log alert rules utilizing cross-workspace queries with resource names or qualified name identifiers is set to be retired on 31 May 2024. This retirement suggests a shift towards more advanced and efficient methods of log alerting within the Azure ecosystem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, Azure has made the Azure Virtual Network Manager security admin rule generally available across 30 regions. This rule enables administrators to manage and enforce security policies for virtual networks, enhancing overall network security and control. This availability in multiple regions signifies the widespread adoption and demand for this feature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other news, Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL has introduced support for Trusted Language Extensions, specifically the croaring-rs and num-bigint crate. This development allows users to leverage these extensions within their PostgreSQL databases, providing additional functionality and capabilities. This expansion of supported extensions demonstrates Amazon's commitment to continuously improving and expanding their database services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, there is no specific information provided in the given news.

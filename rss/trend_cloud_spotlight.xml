        In recent news, there have been two significant developments in the technology world. Firstly, Microsoft has introduced a new feature called Azure Storage Actions, which aims to simplify the management of storage objects. This tool, currently in public preview, allows users to perform various actions on their Azure storage objects, such as copying, moving, and deleting files, without the need for complex coding or scripting. With Azure Storage Actions, users can streamline their storage management processes and improve efficiency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another exciting update, the Istio add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) now supports a plug-in certificate authority (CA). Istio is an open-source service mesh platform that enables users to connect, secure, and monitor microservices. With this new feature, AKS users can now integrate their own certificate authority into Istio, providing enhanced security and control over their microservices communication. This public preview of the Istio add-on for AKS with plug-in CA offers users more flexibility and customization options for their AKS deployments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving on to new tools, products, or projects, there is no specific information available in the given news. However, it is worth mentioning that the technology industry is constantly evolving, and new tools, products, and projects are being introduced regularly. It is always recommended to stay updated with the latest news and announcements from technology companies to discover new advancements and opportunities in the field.

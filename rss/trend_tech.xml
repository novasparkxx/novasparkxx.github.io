        In the world today, several significant events have taken place. Firstly, there is a debate on whether to use Amazon API Gateway in 2024 or consider Function URLs as an alternative. This decision holds importance for businesses and developers who rely on these tools for their operations. Additionally, a controversial claim has been made by Craig Wright, who asserts that he is the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. The question arises whether he can provide sufficient evidence to prove his claim in court. This news has sparked interest and speculation within the cryptocurrency community. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a different note, ZBrush enthusiasts have an exciting opportunity to grab a wide range of alphas and brushes at a 50% discount. This offer presents a chance for artists and designers to enhance their creative projects using these tools. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the technology sector, Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has confirmed the integration of Gen AI (Artificial Intelligence) in their products by the end of the year. This development showcases Apple's commitment to incorporating advanced technologies into their devices, potentially revolutionizing the user experience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shifting focus to environmental concerns, recent data has revealed that Quebec's mining and metal industry consumes billions of liters of water annually. This revelation raises questions about the sustainability and environmental impact of these industries. Efforts to address and mitigate this issue may be necessary to ensure responsible water usage in the future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, an intriguing question arises regarding the presence of lead in Stanley Cups or other reusable water bottles. This issue highlights potential health risks associated with these commonly used items. Understanding the reasons behind the presence of lead and finding solutions to eliminate it from such products is crucial for public health and safety. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, there is no specific information provided in the given news.

        In recent news, it has been reported that a classmate of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the suspect in the shooting incident involving former President Donald Trump, revealed that Crooks was rejected from their high school rifle team due to his poor shooting skills. This sheds light on the suspect's lack of proficiency with firearms, which may have played a role in the unsuccessful attempt on Trump's life. It is a reminder of the importance of proper training and evaluation when it comes to handling weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a different note, I would be happy to share my thoughts on Scala for Functional Programming. Scala is a powerful programming language that combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. It provides a concise and expressive syntax, making it suitable for building scalable and maintainable applications. Functional programming, on the other hand, focuses on writing code that is declarative, immutable, and relies heavily on functions. Scala's support for functional programming makes it a popular choice among developers who want to leverage the benefits of this paradigm. It allows for writing code that is more modular, testable, and easier to reason about. Overall, Scala is a great language for functional programming, and I would highly recommend exploring it further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another news story, it has been revealed that there is no honor among RAM thieves, but sometimes karma catches up with them.

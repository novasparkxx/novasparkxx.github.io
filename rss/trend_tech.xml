        In the world of technology, Southeast Asia's major tech companies, GoTo and Bukalapak, have experienced a decline in their performance. This can be observed through 19 charts that depict their sliding positions in the market. It is evident that these companies are facing challenges and are in need of strategies to regain their momentum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a positive note, Anker, a renowned tech company, has introduced its latest innovation - a fully foldable wireless charger. This new product has garnered much attention and praise, as it offers convenience and portability. The foldable design allows users to easily carry and use the charger wherever they go, making it a highly desirable gadget for tech enthusiasts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, in a surprising turn of events, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has experienced a significant decline in his net worth. In just two days, his wealth plummeted by over $11 billion, causing him to crash out of the prestigious $100 billion club. This news highlights the volatility of the tech industry and the potential risks associated with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, the fully foldable wireless charger by Anker stands out as an exciting development. Its innovative design and functionality offer a glimpse into the future of wireless charging technology. This product could potentially revolutionize the way we charge our devices and pave the way for more portable and user-friendly charging solutions.

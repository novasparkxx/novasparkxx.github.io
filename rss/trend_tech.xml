        In recent news, the tech world has been buzzing with tips on what to do if you forget your Android PIN, pattern, or password. Losing access to your Android device can be frustrating, but there are ways to regain control. One solution is to use your Google account credentials to reset your PIN, pattern, or password. By entering the wrong code multiple times, you will be prompted to enter your Google account details, which will then allow you to reset your security settings. Another option is to use the Find My Device feature, which can remotely erase your device and set it up as new. However, this method will result in the loss of all data on your device, so it is important to have a backup. Additionally, some Android devices offer a fingerprint or facial recognition feature as an alternative to PINs and passwords, making it easier to unlock your device without the need for memorizing complex codes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, the Honor Magic V3 foldable screen smartphone has recently opened up for pre-orders. This highly anticipated device comes in four color options: coffee, white, green, and black. The standout feature of the Honor Magic V3 is its top-tier configuration, boasting a massive 1TB of storage. This impressive storage capacity ensures that users can store a vast amount of data, including photos, videos, and apps, without worrying about running out of space. The foldable screen design adds a touch of versatility, allowing users to switch between a compact phone and a larger tablet-like display. With its sleek design and powerful specifications, the Honor Magic V3 is set to make waves in the smartphone market.

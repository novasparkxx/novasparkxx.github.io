        In recent news, Genshin Impact developer MiHoYo has made an exciting announcement by unveiling an independent PC launcher for its gaming titles. This move is aimed at providing a more streamlined and efficient gaming experience for players. The new launcher will allow users to access MiHoYo's games directly from their PC, eliminating the need for third-party platforms. This development showcases MiHoYo's commitment to enhancing the gaming experience for its dedicated fanbase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another news, India's Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued an order to Kotak Mahindra Bank, directing them to cease onboarding new customers digitally. This decision comes as a result of concerns regarding the bank's compliance with certain regulatory requirements. The RBI's directive will require Kotak Mahindra Bank to reassess and rectify any issues in their digital onboarding process before resuming the acquisition of new customers. This move highlights the importance of adhering to regulatory guidelines in the banking sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, GitHub has introduced a new tool called Infra Copilot, which aims to revolutionize Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Infra Copilot is an extension of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion tool. With this new tool, developers working on infrastructure-related projects can benefit from automated suggestions and code generation, making the process more efficient and error-free. This innovation showcases GitHub's commitment to providing developers with cutting-edge tools to enhance their coding experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a lighter note, a peculiar incident has occurred where someone's mouse climbed a wall, resulting in it malfunctioning. The individual is seeking help to resolve the issue and restore their mouse's functionality. While this may seem like an unusual occurrence, it serves as a reminder of the unexpected challenges that can arise in our daily lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, following the successful launch of Dragon's Dogma 2, Capcom, the renowned game developer, has raised its expected profits. The highly anticipated sequel has garnered significant attention and positive reviews, leading to increased sales and revenue for the company. This achievement highlights the importance of delivering quality gaming experiences and the positive impact it can have on a company's financial performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, the introduction of MiHoYo's independent PC launcher, GitHub's Infra Copilot, and the success of Dragon's Dogma 2 demonstrate the continuous advancements and innovations in the gaming and technology industries. These developments aim to enhance user experiences, streamline processes, and provide developers with powerful tools to improve their work efficiency. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect more exciting tools, products, and projects to shape the world around us.

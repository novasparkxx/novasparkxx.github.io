        In recent global tech news, HKC has launched its new 27-inch G27M7 monitor, which boasts impressive specifications including 4K resolution at 160Hz and FHD at 320Hz, along with a peak brightness of 1000 nits. This monitor is priced at 2499 yuan, making it an attractive option for gamers and professionals seeking high-performance displays. Meanwhile, Apple has adjusted the pricing of its M4 version Mac mini, which is now available for 3358 yuan after government subsidies, making it cheaper than educational discounts and offering a six-month interest-free payment plan. This move is likely to appeal to a broader audience looking for powerful computing solutions at a more accessible price point. Additionally, a discussion has emerged around the current trend in cloud deployments, revealing that 90% of deployments are being carried out using virtual machines (VMs) and serverless architectures rather than Kubernetes. This trend highlights a shift in how organizations are approaching cloud infrastructure, emphasizing the need for more efficient and simplified deployment strategies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;### New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;1. **HKC G27M7 Monitor**: A 27-inch display featuring dual modes (4K 160Hz and FHD 320Hz) and a peak brightness of 1000 nits, priced at 2499 yuan.&lt;br&gt;2. **Apple M4 Mac mini**: Now available for 3358 yuan post-subsidy, offering a competitive price point and a six-month interest-free payment option.&lt;br&gt;3. **Cloud Deployment Trends**: A growing preference for VMs and serverless solutions over Kubernetes, indicating a shift in deployment strategies within the tech industry.

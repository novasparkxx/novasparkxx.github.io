One notable addition is the ability to configure custom SSL settings. This allows users to have more control over their SSL configurations, ensuring enhanced security. Additionally, SafeLine has also implemented rate limiting, which helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage of resources. These updates aim to provide a safer and more efficient experience for users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, there is a focus on frontend development and learning frameworks for the headless and static future. As technology evolves, it is important for developers to stay updated and level up their skills. Learning frameworks can help streamline the development process and improve efficiency.

Both options have their pros and cons, and it ultimately depends on the specific needs and resources of the project. In-house teams offer better control and communication, while outsourcing can provide cost savings and access to specialized expertise. The decision should be based on careful consideration of the project requirements and available resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, there is no specific information provided in the given news.

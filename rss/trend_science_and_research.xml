        Recent developments across various fields highlight significant advancements and ongoing challenges in healthcare, environmental sustainability, and technology. A study published in *Nursing Reports* examined the knowledge and practices of nurses in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, regarding the prevention of Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT), emphasizing the need for improved training and awareness in clinical settings. In the realm of renal health, research in the *International Journal of Molecular Sciences* explored metal-dependent cell death mechanisms in renal fibrosis, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues. Meanwhile, a report in *Pharmacoepidemiology* identified cases of fixed drug eruptions linked to doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis, underscoring the importance of monitoring drug reactions. The *Sustainability* journal discussed the digital transformation of national audits, showcasing a quasi-natural experiment that established digital departments aimed at enhancing regional sustainable development. In technology, the *Sensors* journal introduced DNA-PRESENT, a lightweight cryptographic solution designed for the Internet of Things (IoT), promising improved security and low latency. Additionally, the *Religions* journal examined themes of return migration and belonging in the Hebrew Bible, while *Biomedicines* highlighted the connection between proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases and DNA repair mechanisms. Nutritional studies published in *Nutrients* revealed how dietary lipid profiles affect metabolic syndrome and called for community-specific research to address racial and ethnic disparities in obesity among Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. Lastly, *Applied Sciences* reported on the use of natural extracts as environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitors for carbon steel, reflecting a growing trend towards sustainable materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;### New Tools, Products, or Projects&lt;br&gt;1. **DNA-PRESENT**: A new cryptographic solution for IoT that enhances security while maintaining low latency and lightweight characteristics.&lt;br&gt;2. **Digital Audit Departments**: Initiatives aimed at transforming national audits into digital formats to promote sustainable development practices.&lt;br&gt;3. **Natural Extracts for Corrosion Inhibition**: Research into environmentally friendly alternatives for preventing corrosion in carbon steel, promoting sustainability in industrial applications.

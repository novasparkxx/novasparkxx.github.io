        In the world of food safety, a recent study published in Foods, Vol. 13, Pages 2487, explores the potential use of probiotics and postbiotics as biopreservatives to combat microbial contamination in food. This research highlights the importance of finding innovative solutions to ensure the safety and quality of our food supply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Rwanda. Economies, Vol. 12, Pages 203, presents an analysis of the effects of the pandemic on these businesses, using wood firm-level data. This study sheds light on the challenges faced by SMEs and provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the realm of women's empowerment and mental health, a scoping review published in Women, Vol. 4, Pages 277-289, delves into the relationship between women's empowerment and their mental well-being. This research highlights the importance of addressing gender inequalities and promoting women's empowerment for better mental health outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advances in millimeter-wave treatment and its biological effects development are explored in IJMS, Vol. 25, Pages 8638. This research showcases the potential of millimeter-wave treatment in various applications and its impact on biological systems. Such advancements have the potential to revolutionize medical treatments and therapies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of remote sensing, an analysis of despeckling filters using ratio images and divergence measurement is presented in Remote Sensing, Vol. 16, Pages 2893. This study aims to improve the quality of remote sensing imagery by reducing speckle noise through the use of advanced filters. These findings contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable remote sensing technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Biomolecules, Vol. 14, Pages 964, explores the role of microglia, often referred to as the "drunken gardeners of early adversity," in early brain development. This research sheds light on the complex interactions between microglia and their impact on neurological processes, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic interventions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, a study on the effects of different types of footwear on the kinematics and kinetics of lower limb joints during walking is presented. This research, titled "How boots affect the kinematics and kinetics of lower limb joints during walking compared to casual footwear," examines the potential impact of footwear choices on human biomechanics and offers insights for improving footwear design.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of clean technology, a comparative analysis of CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes) from Trichoderma longibrachiatum LMBC 172 cultured with three different carbon sources is conducted. Published in Clean Technol., Vol. 6, Pages 994-1010, this study compares the enzymatic capabilities of Trichoderma longibrachiatum LMBC 172 when cultured with sugarcane bagasse, tamarind seeds, and hemicellulose simulation. These findings contribute to the development of sustainable and efficient bioconversion processes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, Diversity, Vol. 16, Pages 482, presents a comparative assessment of shell structural, mechanical, and elemental properties in adult acorn barnacles. This research provides insights into the adaptations and characteristics of these marine organisms, contributing to our understanding of biodiversity and ecological systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;- A novel despeckling filter for remote sensing imagery that utilizes ratio images and divergence measurement.&lt;br&gt;- The development of probiotics and postbiotics as potential biopreservatives to combat microbial contamination in food.&lt;br&gt;- Advances in millimeter-wave treatment and its potential biological effects on various applications.&lt;br&gt;- Comparative analysis of CAZymes from Trichoderma longibrachiatum LMBC 172 cultured with different carbon sources, contributing to sustainable bioconversion processes.&lt;br&gt;- Insights into the adaptations and properties of adult acorn barnacles, enhancing our understanding of biodiversity and ecological systems.

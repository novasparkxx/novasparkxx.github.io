        Recent developments in scientific research highlight significant advancements across various fields, particularly in drug discovery, cancer treatment, and biotechnology. A study published in the *International Journal of Molecular Sciences* (IJMS) examined the reliability of AlphaFold2 models in virtual drug screening, focusing on Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are crucial targets in pharmacology. Another publication provided an overview of autism, offering insights and solution approaches for affected individuals and their families. In oncology, research in *Cancers* explored the diagnostic performance of dual-phase 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET-mpMRI in distinguishing between brain tumor radionecrosis and recurrence post-radiotherapy, suggesting its potential for routine clinical use. Additionally, a study in *Animals* introduced a rapid detection method for differentiating between attenuated and wild strains of Duck Hepatitis A Virus-1 using a novel mutation assay. In cognitive science, research in *Brain Sciences* analyzed the interplay of social information processing, self-regulation, and metacognition on theory of mind. Furthermore, a new rehabilitation assessment platform utilizing on-skin sensors and a multi-task gait transformer model was developed to enhance patient care. In the realm of oncology, *Current Oncology* reported on real-world treatment patterns for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma receiving Avelumab, shedding light on treatment outcomes. Innovations in materials science were also noted, with advancements in blue perovskite light-emitting diodes and corrosion inhibition techniques for metals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;### New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;1. **AlphaFold2 Models**: Enhanced virtual drug screening capabilities focusing on GPCRs.&lt;br&gt;2. **Mismatch Amplification Mutation Assay-PCR**: A rapid detection tool for Duck Hepatitis A Virus-1.&lt;br&gt;3. **Rehabilitation Assessment Platform**: A comprehensive system using on-skin sensors and AI for gait analysis.&lt;br&gt;4. **Dual-Phase PET-mpMRI**: A diagnostic tool for differentiating brain tumor conditions post-radiotherapy.&lt;br&gt;5. **Zelkovamycin Analogues**: New anticancer compounds synthesized for potential therapeutic use.&lt;br&gt;6. **Blue Perovskite Light-Emitting Diodes**: Innovations aimed at improving the efficiency and stability of light-emitting devices.&lt;br&gt;7. **Corrosion Inhibition Techniques**: New methods for preventing galvanic corrosion in metal applications.

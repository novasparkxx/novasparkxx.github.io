        In the world of agronomy, a study published in the journal Agronomy explores the effects of refrigerated storage on the restarted morphological development of Dictyophora indusiata fruiting bodies. The research delves into the impact of temperature on the growth and development of these fruiting bodies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of polymers, a paper published in the journal Polymers focuses on enhancing sustainability in PLA membrane preparation. The study investigates the use of biobased solvents to improve the sustainability of the process, aiming to reduce the environmental impact of PLA membrane production.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The journal Viruses presents a study that provides useful clinical criteria for identifying neonates with congenital cytomegalovirus infection at birth. This research is particularly relevant in the context of an expanded targeted screening program, as it helps healthcare professionals accurately diagnose and treat infants with this viral infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving on to the field of medicine, the International Journal of Molecular Sciences (IJMS) features a study that examines platelet contribution and endothelial activation and stress index as potential mortality predictors in traumatic brain injury. This research sheds light on the factors that may influence the outcome of traumatic brain injuries, providing valuable insights for medical professionals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the realm of batteries, a paper published in the journal Batteries presents a numerical modeling study of a low-cobalt all-solid-state cell with ceramic electrolyte. The research focuses on understanding the behavior and performance of this type of battery, contributing to the development of more efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of engineering, a study compares the seismic performance and cost of RC moment resisting and dual frames using UBC 97 and IBC 2021. This research, published in a seismic engineering journal, provides valuable insights for designing and constructing earthquake-resistant structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Journal of Clinical Medicine (JCM) features a study that investigates the effect of age on high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support in multiple myeloma. This single-center experience sheds light on the impact of age on the effectiveness and safety of this treatment approach for multiple myeloma patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the realm of applied sciences, a study published in the journal Applied Sciences explores the effect of radiation intensity on the performance of direct-expansion solar PVT heat pump systems. This research contributes to the understanding of how radiation intensity influences the efficiency and effectiveness of solar thermal systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The journal Geosciences presents a study that focuses on the preparation phase of the 2022 ML 5.7 offshore Fano earthquake in Italy. Using a multiparametric-multilayer approach, the research aims to understand the geological and seismological factors leading up to the earthquake, providing valuable insights for earthquake preparedness and mitigation strategies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, the journal Mathematics features a study that conducts sensitivity analysis and uncertainty assessment of a myocardial infarction model. This research explores the reliability and robustness of the model, contributing to the understanding of the factors that may affect the accuracy of myocardial infarction predictions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, the provided news articles do not explicitly mention any.

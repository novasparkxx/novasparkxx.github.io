        Recent developments across various fields highlight a blend of health, technology, sustainability, and heritage conservation. Research on lactic acid-fermented *Arthrospira platensis* suggests promising bioactivities that could enhance functional beverages, potentially revolutionizing the beverage industry with health-focused products. In the realm of infectious diseases, a study on Coxsackievirus A6 in the UK reveals significant genetic and clinical epidemiology shifts before and after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, underscoring the ongoing impact of the pandemic on viral infections. Meanwhile, the integration of emerging technologies with digital twins is being explored for heritage building conservation, offering innovative strategies to preserve cultural assets through interdisciplinary collaboration. Sustainability efforts are also gaining traction, with preliminary design strategies aimed at personal data management in smart product-service systems, focusing on ethical user engagement in democratic processes. Urban ecological studies emphasize the importance of functional zoning in urban fringe areas, balancing ecological and social values, while a comparative metabolomic analysis of various *Salvia* species reveals potential antinociceptive effects, contributing to the understanding of pain management. Additionally, the unmet needs in the care of lysosomal storage disorders highlight gaps in early diagnosis and caregiving pathways, particularly in Italy. Urban nature preserves are recognized for their role in supporting rare and endemic flora, while socio-demographic and territorial transformations in the Ricote Valley region of Spain illustrate the dynamic interplay between landscape and community. Finally, a prospective analysis of placebo effects sheds light on the neurological mechanisms that drive physiological and belief responses, furthering our understanding of the mind-body connection in healthcare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;### New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;1. **Functional Beverages**: Development of new health-oriented beverages utilizing lactic acid-fermented *Arthrospira platensis*.&lt;br&gt;2. **Digital Twins for Heritage Conservation**: Innovative tools combining emerging technologies with digital twins to enhance the preservation of heritage buildings.&lt;br&gt;3. **Smart Product-Service Systems**: Preliminary design strategies aimed at ethical personal data management to prevent user manipulation in democratic processes.&lt;br&gt;4. **Ecological Zoning Frameworks**: New methodologies for ecological functional zoning in urban areas, balancing ecological and social values.&lt;br&gt;5. **Metabolomic Analysis Tools**: Advanced analytical techniques for studying the antinociceptive properties of various *Salvia* species.&lt;br&gt;6. **Healthcare Pathways for Lysosomal Storage Disorders**: Initiatives aimed at improving early diagnosis and caregiving for patients with lysosomal storage disorders.&lt;br&gt;7. **Urban Nature Preservation Projects**: Conservation efforts focused on maintaining habitats for rare and endemic flora in urban settings.

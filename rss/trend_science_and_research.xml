        Recent scientific advancements have shed light on various critical issues affecting health, the environment, and technology. Research into the venom glands of Bothrops asper and Bothrops jararaca has unveiled novel toxic proteins that could lead to new pharmacological applications, highlighting the potential of animal venoms as a source of active compounds. In the realm of environmental science, a study on layered double hydroxides (LDH) combined with graphene and g-C3N4 has demonstrated promising results for the removal of pharmaceutical contaminants from water, showcasing innovative approaches to tackling pollution. Additionally, a large cohort study has confirmed the long-term effectiveness and safety of Ustekinumab in treating Crohn’s disease, providing valuable insights for patients and healthcare providers. Energy research has focused on the mechanical properties of tire wheels, revealing how changes in stiffness and damping can affect low-speed vehicle performance, while another study has analyzed the driving effects of greenhouse gas emissions in Southeast Asia, emphasizing the need for targeted environmental policies. Furthermore, the impact of soil liming in Poland has been modeled to understand its ecological consequences, and research on granulosa cells has highlighted their crucial role in female fertility. Lastly, a study on land certification in rural China has explored its effects on governance and inequality, providing a nuanced understanding of rural development dynamics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;### New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;1. **Novel Toxic Proteins**: Ongoing research into the venom of Bothrops species may lead to the development of new pharmaceuticals derived from these proteins.&lt;br&gt;2. **LDH/Graphene and LDH/g-C3N4 Systems**: Innovative materials for water purification that can effectively remove pharmaceutical contaminants.&lt;br&gt;3. **Ustekinumab Treatment Protocols**: Enhanced treatment guidelines for Crohn’s disease based on real-life cohort study findings.&lt;br&gt;4. **Tire Wheel Performance Analysis Tools**: New methodologies for assessing tire performance that could improve vehicle safety and efficiency.&lt;br&gt;5. **Soil Liming Models**: Advanced modeling tools for predicting the ecological impacts of soil management practices.&lt;br&gt;6. **Granulosa Cell Research**: Potential new therapies targeting granulosa cells to enhance female fertility.&lt;br&gt;7. **Land Certification Frameworks**: Projects aimed at improving governance and reducing inequality in rural land management in China.

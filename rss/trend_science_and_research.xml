        In the world today, various research studies and investigations have been conducted across different fields. In the medical field, a randomized controlled clinical trial compared the effects of preoperative administration of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in the surgical extraction of impacted lower third molars. This study aimed to determine the most effective approach for this procedure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the food industry, a five-year review focused on the use of Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil in meat-based functional foods for meat preservation. The study aimed to explore the potential benefits of using this essential oil as a natural preservative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another investigation took place in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area, Thailand, specifically in cat cafés. The study examined the presence of zoonotic enteric nematodes and dermatophytes in these establishments, highlighting the importance of maintaining hygiene and preventing the spread of diseases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consumer perception of new aquaculture products was evaluated through the application of focus group and check-all-that-apply methodologies. This research aimed to understand how consumers perceive and accept these new products, providing valuable insights for the aquaculture industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of processes, simulation and analysis were conducted to study the hydrodynamic behavior in different nozzles and their corresponding fluidized beds. This research aimed to optimize the design and efficiency of fluidized bed systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The potential use of a common administration of emulsion for parenteral nutrition and vinpocetine was explored in a compatibility study. This study investigated the compatibility of these substances and their potential benefits in the field of nutrition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Modeling of high-power graded-index fiber amplifiers was the focus of research in the field of photonics. This study aimed to develop models that can enhance the performance of fiber amplifiers, contributing to advancements in optical communication systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The relationship between mixtures of urinary phenol and phthalate metabolite concentrations and serum lipid levels among pregnant women was investigated. This study was part of the EARTH Study, providing insights into the potential impact of environmental exposures on maternal health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the agricultural sector, the sustainability of organic fertilizers use in dryland Mediterranean agriculture was examined. This research aimed to assess the long-term viability and environmental impact of organic fertilizers in this specific agricultural context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, the synthesis of flexible polyamide aerogels cross-linked with a tri-isocyanate was explored in the field of gels. This study focused on developing flexible and lightweight materials with potential applications in various industries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;- The development of a natural preservative using Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil for meat-based functional foods.&lt;br&gt;- The investigation of zoonotic enteric nematodes and dermatophytes in cat cafés, highlighting the importance of hygiene in these establishments.&lt;br&gt;- The evaluation of consumer perception of new aquaculture products through focus group and check-all-that-apply methodologies.&lt;br&gt;- The optimization of fluidized bed systems through the simulation and analysis of hydrodynamic behavior in different nozzles.&lt;br&gt;- The compatibility study of a common administration of emulsion for parenteral nutrition and vinpocetine.&lt;br&gt;- The modeling of high-power graded-index fiber amplifiers for improved performance in optical communication systems.&lt;br&gt;- The examination of the relationship between environmental exposures and maternal health in pregnant women.&lt;br&gt;- The assessment of the sustainability and environmental impact of organic fertilizers in dryland Mediterranean agriculture.&lt;br&gt;- The synthesis of flexible polyamide aerogels with potential applications in various industries.

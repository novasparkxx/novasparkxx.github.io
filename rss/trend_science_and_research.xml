        Based on the provided news articles, several developments have taken place in various fields. In the field of behavioral sciences, a quantitative study has been conducted on the stress, coping, and adjustment of international students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to understand the impact of the pandemic on the mental well-being of international students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of chemosensors, recent progress has been made in MXenes-based materials for gas sensors and photodetectors. This research focuses on developing advanced materials that can detect and analyze gases, as well as detect and measure light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A study in the field of biomedicines has found that ceftriaxone, a drug commonly used to treat bacterial infections, can inhibit conditioned fear and compulsive-like repetitive behavior in mice. This study suggests that ceftriaxone may have potential therapeutic applications for anxiety-related disorders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another study in biomedicines explores the use of microRNA networks to understand pancreatic cancer. By analyzing the interactions between microRNAs, this research aims to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatic cancer development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of engineering, a study highlights the underrecognized threat of CO2 to worker safety during construction activity. This research emphasizes the importance of implementing proper safety measures to protect workers from CO2 exposure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of cancer research, a study has found that bufalin, a natural compound derived from a traditional Chinese medicine, can suppress the development of head and neck cancer. This research suggests that bufalin may have potential as a therapeutic agent for this type of cancer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of plant science, a study investigates the variability in maize seed bacterization and its correlation with root colonization by Pseudomonas isolates with plant-probiotic traits. This research aims to understand the factors influencing the survival and colonization of beneficial bacteria in maize plants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of genetics, a study focuses on whole-exome analysis for Polish Caucasian patients with retinal dystrophies. This research aims to identify genetic mutations associated with these disorders and create a reference genomic database for the Polish population.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, in the field of urban infrastructure, a study proposes an adaptive difference least squares support vector regression model for predicting the timing of urban road collapse. This research aims to develop a predictive tool that can help prevent infrastructure failures and ensure public safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, these studies and projects contribute to advancements in various fields, ranging from mental health and biomedical research to engineering and genetics. These developments have the potential to improve our understanding of complex issues and lead to the development of new tools, products, and projects that can benefit society.

        Recent advancements in science and technology have led to significant developments across various fields, particularly in health monitoring, energy storage, and therapeutic interventions. Researchers have introduced hygrosensitive dynamic covalent organic framework films that utilize molecular rotors to create moisture-driven actuation systems, which could revolutionize wearable health monitoring devices. In the realm of energy storage, a new in situ sulfurization strategy has been developed for heterostructured SnS2@Graphene scrolls, enhancing the initial Coulombic efficiency of lithium storage, thereby improving battery performance. Additionally, innovative therapies for ischemic stroke are emerging, with M2 macrophage-derived exosomes showing promise in inhibiting neutrophil extracellular traps. In the field of electrocatalysis, advancements in dimensional upgrades have intensified intramolecular electron donor-acceptor interactions, boosting oxygen reduction reactions. Furthermore, engineered microglia-exosomes coated with highly twisting AIE photothermal agents are being designed to cross the blood-brain barrier, offering new avenues for glioblastoma treatment through mild photothermal-immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The fight against counterfeiting has also seen progress with the development of optical and terahertz anticounterfeiting tags using non-deterministic deposition of fluorescent extracts. In environmental applications, atomic praseodymium doping in Bi nanofibers is being explored for high-energy-efficiency CO2 electrolysis. Lastly, the healthcare sector is benefiting from advancements in soft sensing devices, and organosulfur cathodes are bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical applications in lithium metal batteries. Notably, nano-enabled techniques are being utilized to regulate dopaminergic neuronal differentiation, offering potential therapies for Parkinson's disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;### New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;1. **Hygrosensitive Dynamic Covalent Organic Framework Films** - A new material for moisture-driven actuation in wearable health devices.&lt;br&gt;2. **Heterostructured SnS2@Graphene Scrolls** - Enhanced anode materials for lithium batteries, improving energy storage efficiency.&lt;br&gt;3. **M2 Macrophage-Derived Exosomes** - A therapeutic approach for ischemic stroke that inhibits harmful neutrophil activity.&lt;br&gt;4. **Engineered Microglia-Exosomes** - Advanced agents for crossing the blood-brain barrier to treat glioblastoma.&lt;br&gt;5. **Optical and Terahertz Anticounterfeiting Tags** - Innovative security features to combat product counterfeiting.&lt;br&gt;6. **Atomic Praseodymium Doping in Bi Nanofibers** - A project aimed at improving CO2 electrolysis efficiency.&lt;br&gt;7. **1D Soft Sensing Devices** - New healthcare applications for monitoring and diagnostics.&lt;br&gt;8. **Organosulfur Cathodes** - Bridging theoretical research with practical applications in lithium metal batteries.&lt;br&gt;9. **Nano-Enabled Techniques for Neuronal Differentiation** - A novel approach to treating Parkinson's disease through cellular regulation.

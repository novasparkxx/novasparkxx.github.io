        In the world of science and technology, several advancements and research projects have been taking place. In the field of solar energy, a review of CIGS thin film semiconductor deposition for solar cell applications has been conducted, focusing on the techniques of sputtering and thermal evaporation. This research aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of solar cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the healthcare sector, a novel methodological approach for mental health has been developed, linking affect dynamics and well-being. This approach seeks to understand the relationship between emotions and overall mental well-being, providing valuable insights for mental health professionals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cancer research has also made significant progress, with a study on osteopontin and its role in regulating Treg cell stability and function. This research has implications for anti-tumor immunity and autoimmunity, potentially leading to new treatments and therapies for cancer patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the maritime industry, a project on combustion control of ship's oil-fired boilers has been undertaken. This project utilizes the prediction of flame images to improve the efficiency and safety of boilers on ships, contributing to a more sustainable and reliable maritime sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of education, a framework has been developed for the research-based and interdisciplinary use of sensors in elementary teacher education. This framework aims to enhance the teaching and learning experience by incorporating sensor technology into the classroom, providing students with hands-on and interactive learning opportunities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, a spectral detection method for trace copper in high-concentration zinc solution has been proposed. This method, based on integrated and partition modeling, can accurately detect and measure trace amounts of copper, which is crucial in various industries such as mining and metallurgy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the construction industry, a numerical investigation has been conducted to study the influence of foundation pit excavation on the deformation of underlying tunnels. This research aims to improve the safety and stability of underground structures during construction projects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In horticulture, a study has been conducted to increase sweet orange growth in winter nurseries using supplemental light and heating. This research aims to optimize the growth conditions for sweet oranges, ensuring a higher yield and quality of fruits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In atmospheric science, the long-term validation of Aeolus Level-2B winds in the Brazilian Amazon has been carried out. This validation process ensures the accuracy and reliability of wind data collected by the Aeolus satellite, contributing to a better understanding of atmospheric dynamics and weather forecasting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, in the field of animal research, enteropathogenic and multidrug-resistant E. coli isolates carrying the blaCTX-M gene have been identified in dogs and cats. This finding highlights the importance of monitoring and controlling antibiotic resistance in animals, as it poses a threat to both animal and human health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;- A novel methodological approach for mental health, linking affect dynamics and well-being.&lt;br&gt;- The development of a framework for the research-based and interdisciplinary use of sensors in elementary teacher education.&lt;br&gt;- A spectral detection method for trace copper in high-concentration zinc solution.&lt;br&gt;- The numerical investigation of the influence of foundation pit excavation on the deformation of underlying tunnels.&lt;br&gt;- The use of supplemental light and heating to increase sweet orange growth in winter nurseries.&lt;br&gt;- The long-term validation of Aeolus Level-2B winds in the Brazilian Amazon.&lt;br&gt;- The identification of enteropathogenic and multidrug-resistant E. coli isolates carrying the blaCTX-M gene in dogs and cats.

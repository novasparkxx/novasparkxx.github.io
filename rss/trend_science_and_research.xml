        In recent news, several scientific journals have published studies on various topics. "Cancers" has focused on strategies to improve CAR T cell persistence in solid tumors, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments. "Sustainability" has conducted a systematic review of innovations in clay-based irrigation technologies, exploring ways to optimize water usage in agriculture. "Energies" has provided a comprehensive review of strategies for efficient flexible piezoelectric polymer composites based on BaTiO3, with the goal of advancing energy harvesting for future applications. "Nutrients" has conducted a 30-year retrospective study on the BMI status of children with celiac disease, revealing changes in their health over time. "Applied Sciences" has examined the mechanical properties of fractured sandy mudstone through triaxial compression experiments, contributing to a better understanding of geological materials. "Biomolecules" has investigated the role of decidualized endometrial stromal cells in promoting mitochondrial beta-oxidation for successful implantation. "Toxins" has analyzed patient characteristics and real-world use of botulinum toxins for the treatment of cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, and hemifacial spasm. "Metals" has conducted experimental characterization and first-principles calculations of Zn segregation at the β″-Mg5Al2Si4/Al interfaces in Al-Mg-Si alloys, providing insights into the behavior of these materials. Lastly, "AI" has explored prompt engineering for knowledge creation, using chain-of-thought to support students' improvable ideas and enhance their learning experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, there is no specific information provided in the given news titles.

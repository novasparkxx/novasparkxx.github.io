        Recent advancements in various scientific fields have highlighted significant developments that could impact both industry and healthcare. A novel long short-term memory (LSTM) sequence-to-sequence model has been introduced for predicting dam deformation, utilizing chaos-based optimization and an attention mechanism, which could enhance safety measures in civil engineering. In the realm of sustainable practices, research has optimized the recovery of cellulose from olive-tree pruning using microwave-assisted methods with three different solvents, potentially improving waste management in agriculture. Fluid dynamics studies have also made strides with mesh sensitivity analysis of axisymmetric models, which could lead to better predictions of transient flows in engineering applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the pharmaceutical sector, a study evaluated novel co-processed excipients that enable direct compression and modified release of ibuprofen, paving the way for more efficient drug formulations. Additionally, research on long non-coding RNA AP001007 has shown its protective effects on human renal tubular epithelial cells and kidney organoids from injury, indicating potential therapeutic avenues for kidney diseases. The oil and gas industry is also benefiting from new predictive models based on SVD-K-Means algorithms, specifically in identifying oil-bearing zones in the Beibu Gulf Basin, which could enhance exploration strategies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Healthcare technology has seen advancements as well, with the StimaWELL 120MTRS system demonstrating immediate effects on multifidus stiffness in patients suffering from chronic low back pain through neuromuscular electrical stimulation. Virtual reality research has explored the influence of realism on the sense of presence, utilizing EEG neurophysiological insights to improve immersive experiences. Lastly, a meta-analysis has reviewed the effects of probiotics in post-bariatric surgery obesity, providing valuable insights into dietary interventions for weight management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;### New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;1. **LSTM Seq2Seq Model**: A predictive model for dam deformation that incorporates chaos-based optimization and attention mechanisms.&lt;br&gt;2. **Microwave-Assisted Cellulose Recovery**: A new method for extracting cellulose from olive-tree pruning, enhancing agricultural waste management.&lt;br&gt;3. **StimaWELL 120MTRS System**: A neuromuscular electrical stimulation device that aids in reducing stiffness in chronic low back pain patients.&lt;br&gt;4. **SVD-K-Means Algorithm**: A predictive tool for identifying oil and gas-bearing zones, improving exploration efficiency in the Beibu Gulf Basin.&lt;br&gt;5. **Novel Co-Processed Excipients**: New pharmaceutical excipients that facilitate direct compression and modified release formulations for ibuprofen.

        In the world of microbiology, a prospective longitudinal study was conducted to examine the dynamics of human papillomavirus 6 and 11 infection in anogenital hairs and eyebrows of male patients with anogenital warts and age-matched controls. This study aimed to gain a better understanding of the transmission and persistence of these specific types of HPV infections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of structural health monitoring, researchers focused on mitigating the impact of temperature variations on ultrasonic guided wave-based techniques. They utilized variational autoencoders to develop a method that could effectively compensate for temperature changes, ensuring accurate and reliable structural health monitoring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The relationship between olive oil and its substitutes was explored in the context of food inflation. An examination was conducted to understand the dynamic nexus between olive oil and its substitutes, shedding light on the factors influencing food inflation and providing insights into potential strategies for managing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Geographic Information Systems (GIS) played a crucial role in a functional method developed for analyzing open-space ratios around individual buildings. This method was implemented using GIS technology, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of open-space ratios and their impact on urban planning and development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of genetics, a genome-wide association study was conducted to identify putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and candidate genes associated with growth and meat traits in Japanese quail. This study aimed to uncover genetic factors that contribute to desirable traits in quail breeding programs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A novel long-period grating with asymmetrical modulation was developed for curvature sensing. This technological advancement in the field of applied sciences has the potential to enhance the accuracy and sensitivity of curvature sensing applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers explored the potential of clinically effective molecules of natural origin for obesity prevention or treatment. This study focused on identifying natural compounds that could be utilized as therapeutic agents in the battle against obesity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the realm of education sciences, storytelling was employed as a pedagogical tool to address students' misconceptions and promote modeling competencies in science. Specifically, the classic tale of "Romeo and Juliet" was used to engage students and facilitate their understanding of scientific concepts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, in the field of horticulture, an entomopathogenic fungus called Pseudozyma flocculosa was identified and evaluated for its efficacy against Tetranychus urticae Koch, a common pest in horticultural settings. This research aimed to provide sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions for pest control in horticulture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;- Variational autoencoders for mitigating temperature variations in ultrasonic guided wave-based structural health monitoring&lt;br&gt;- Functional method for analyzing open-space ratios around individual buildings using GIS technology&lt;br&gt;- Long-period grating with asymmetrical modulation for improved curvature sensing&lt;br&gt;- Identification of clinically effective molecules of natural origin for obesity prevention or treatment&lt;br&gt;- Storytelling as a pedagogical tool to promote modeling competencies in science education&lt;br&gt;- Evaluation of the entomopathogenic fungus Pseudozyma flocculosa for pest control in horticulture.

        In the world of pharmaceuticals, a study was conducted on the design, synthesis, and evaluation of Oleyl-WRH peptides for siRNA delivery. This research aimed to develop effective methods for delivering siRNA, a promising tool for gene therapy. Meanwhile, in the field of materials, a study investigated the effects of curing conditions on the pore structure of Ultra-High-Strength Shotcrete (UHSSC) using X-ray computed tomography. This research aimed to optimize the production process of UHSSC, a high-strength concrete used in construction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advancements in cognitive computing were explored in the field of remote sensing. Researchers focused on improving precision crop protection through the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery for targeted weed monitoring. This innovative approach aimed to enhance agricultural practices and reduce the use of herbicides. In the field of catalysis, a study delved into the properties and applications of intermetallic compounds. These compounds have shown potential in catalytic processes, opening up new possibilities for efficient chemical reactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The influence of various factors on the change of phyllosphere microbial communities in three Populus spp. trees in the same habitat was investigated in the field of forests. This research aimed to understand the complex interactions between trees and their microbial communities, providing insights into forest ecology. Additionally, a review examined the impact of COVID-19 on influenza vaccination coverage in children over five seasons in Central Catalonia, Spain. The study aimed to assess how the pandemic affected vaccination rates and identify potential strategies for improvement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of plants, a study focused on the design and optimization of 3D-printed tablets containing Mucuna extracts for the management of erectile dysfunction. This research utilized a design of experiments (DoE) approach to develop personalized and effective treatment options. Furthermore, a study explored the use of fly ash and alccofine as sustainable cementitious materials, aiming to find eco-friendly alternatives for traditional cement production.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the medical field, a scoping review examined the perspectives on using multiple flaps reconstructions for advanced head and neck tumors. This research aimed to provide insights into reconstructive surgery techniques for challenging cases. Lastly, in the realm of food authentication, DNA barcoding was employed to authenticate high-value snow lotus seed food products. This innovative approach aimed to ensure the quality and authenticity of these valuable food items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;- The use of Oleyl-WRH peptides for siRNA delivery in gene therapy.&lt;br&gt;- X-ray computed tomography for analyzing the pore structure of Ultra-High-Strength Shotcrete (UHSSC) in construction.&lt;br&gt;- Cognitive computing advancements for targeted weed monitoring in precision crop protection.&lt;br&gt;- Intermetallic compounds for catalytic applications.&lt;br&gt;- 3D-printed tablets containing Mucuna extracts for erectile dysfunction management.&lt;br&gt;- Fly ash and alccofine as sustainable cementitious materials.&lt;br&gt;- DNA barcoding for authenticating high-value snow lotus seed food products.

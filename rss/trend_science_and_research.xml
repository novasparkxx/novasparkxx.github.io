        In recent news, various scientific journals have published studies and research findings on a range of topics. "Molecules" presents a study on the gene cloning and heterologous expression of chitinase B from Serratia marcescens, which aims to control the infestation of Spodoptera frugiperda larvae in maize crops. "Sensors" introduces a graph-based audio classification method that utilizes pre-trained models and graph neural networks. Meanwhile, "Machines" discusses the development of a path-following sliding mode controller for electric vehicles, taking into account actuator dynamics. In the medical field, "JCM" presents a narrative review on ventilator weaning in prolonged mechanical ventilation, while "Current Oncology" focuses on identifying prognostic factors associated with tumor recurrence and overall survival in soft tissue sarcomas. Additionally, "Water" addresses the assessment and sustainable management strategies for plastic waste in Can Tho City, Vietnam, adopting a circular economy approach. Lastly, "Cancers" examines the patient-relevant costs of organ preservation versus radical resection in locally advanced rectal cancer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, there is no specific information provided in the given news titles.

        In recent advancements across various scientific fields, researchers have made significant strides in materials science, nanotechnology, and energy solutions. A groundbreaking study introduced versatile papertronics, which utilize photo-induced synapses for enhanced security applications on paper, indicating a new frontier in smart materials. In the realm of energy, the cation dependence in alkaline hydrogen evolution was unveiled through the study of ruthenium/molybdenum sulfide hybrids, suggesting more efficient pathways for hydrogen production. Additionally, innovative protein nanoprobes designed for multiplexed imaging of cancer lymphatic metastasis were developed, showcasing the potential for improved cancer diagnostics and treatment monitoring. A novel strategy for constructing Janus catholyte/cathode structures was also reported, which promises enhanced stability for zinc-organic batteries, a crucial advancement for energy storage technologies. Furthermore, atomic-level observations revealed potential-dependent variations at the surface of oxide catalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction, providing insights into catalytic processes. The discovery of WS2 moiré superlattices supporting gold nanoclusters and isolated ruthenium has been shown to significantly boost hydrogen production, while grain boundary filling techniques have empowered zinc metal anodes with superior stability. Lastly, researchers achieved ultra-broadband sunlight-like emission in single-phase phosphors, highlighting the interplay of structure and luminescence, which could have implications for lighting and display technologies. The robust growth of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide vertical heterostructures via ammonium-assisted CVD strategy further emphasizes the ongoing innovation in material synthesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;### New Tools, Products, or Projects:&lt;br&gt;1. **Versatile Papertronics**: Smart paper technology utilizing photo-induced synapses for security applications.&lt;br&gt;2. **Triple-Targeted Protein Nanoprobes**: Advanced imaging tools for cancer diagnostics, enabling multiplexed analysis of lymphatic metastasis.&lt;br&gt;3. **Janus Catholyte/Cathode Structures**: A new design for zinc-organic batteries aimed at improving stability and performance.&lt;br&gt;4. **WS2 Moiré Superlattices**: Novel structures that enhance hydrogen production efficiency through the integration of nanoclusters.&lt;br&gt;5. **Ultra-Broadband Phosphors**: New phosphor materials capable of emitting sunlight-like spectra, with potential applications in lighting and displays.&lt;br&gt;6. **2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterostructures**: Innovative materials synthesized using ammonium-assisted methods for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications.

        In recent news, several scientific journals have published studies on various topics. In the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, a study investigates the short- and long-term neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure to valproic acid in zebrafish. This research aims to shed light on the potential impact of this substance on neurological development. Another journal, Biomedicines, features an article discussing the use of amantadine for traumatic brain injury. The study explores the supporting evidence and mode of action of this medication in treating such injuries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of virology, the journal Viruses reports on the high rates of miscarriage and stillbirth among pregnant women with Clade I Mpox (Monkeypox) during the 2023â€“2024 outbreak in South Kivu Province, DR Congo. This research confirms the devastating impact of the virus on pregnant women and highlights the need for further understanding and preventive measures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving on to technology, the journal Remote Sensing presents a study on the reflection-polarization characteristics of greenhouses using drone-polarimetry. The focus is on the polarized light pollution of glass surfaces, aiming to identify potential solutions to minimize this issue. Additionally, the same journal discusses the use of generative adversarial networks for SAR automatic target recognition and classification models enhanced explainability. This research explores the perspectives and challenges of utilizing these networks in remote sensing applications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of energy, the journal Energies introduces a novel fault protection method for flexible DC power systems. This method aims to enhance the reliability and safety of these systems. Another journal, Land, presents a study on quantifying the acceptance and challenges of urban wildscapes in Chiba, Japan. This research evaluates public perception and understanding of these natural spaces within an urban environment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, the journal Electronics features a study on fine-grained few-shot image classification based on feature dual reconstruction. This research explores new techniques for improving image classification accuracy in scenarios with limited training data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These recent publications showcase the diverse range of scientific research and technological advancements happening around the world. Each study contributes to our understanding of various fields and presents potential solutions to existing challenges.

        In recent news, there has been an alarming rise in measles cases due to low vaccination rates. This concerning trend is putting many individuals at risk and highlights the importance of immunization. In another study, it has been discovered that clownfish have the ability to recognize the number of stripes on other fish's bodies. Interestingly, they use this knowledge to bully competitors with different patterns. Moving on to a surprising case, police have cracked the mystery of Alaskan bear cubs found over 3,600 miles away from home in Florida. The story behind how they got there is quite unexpected. In the tech world, sales of iPhones have seen a slight rise, although shares have fallen by 3%. Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated that he will not make a deal to bring back a "lifesaving" health feature to Apple Watches. Additionally, a new study reveals that blood pressure pulsations can modulate central neuronal activity through mechanosensitive ion channels. Furthermore, scientists have created a map that shows how pregnancy changes the way organs interact, providing valuable insights into the physiological changes during pregnancy. The urgency to save large, endangered mammals is also highlighted in the news, questioning whether science can act fast enough to prevent their extinction. In the field of artificial intelligence, a groundbreaking project has taught an AI to learn language by seeing the world through a baby's eyes. Lastly, a correction has been made to a previous article regarding the lung microbiome in critically ill patients with acute bacterial and viral pneumonia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, one notable development is the construction of multiple Z-complementary code sets with inter-set low correlation. This advancement in coding techniques has the potential to enhance various fields such as telecommunications and data transmission.

        In the world of banking, a new report from Citi suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) could potentially automate more than half of banking jobs. This development could have significant implications for the industry and its workforce. Meanwhile, two AI-focused exchange-traded funds, WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund and First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF, experienced some trading fluctuations. On the tech front, Apple has delayed the release of new AI features in Europe, citing regulatory concerns. However, Anthropic, an AI company, has introduced a new AI model that is being touted as the "most intelligent yet." In academia, an LLM (Legal Master of Laws) program has achieved a remarkable score of 65% on the GPQA (General Problem-solving and Question-answering) test, surpassing the performance level of regular PhDs. Stability AI, another AI company, has undergone a change in leadership as it continues to innovate in the field of generative AI. In the realm of conservation, AI is playing an increasingly important role in protecting critically endangered marine animals. Additionally, a specialized dataset and leaderboard called RABBITS has been introduced to evaluate the performance of LLMs in healthcare. Lastly, facial recognition startup Clearview AI has settled a privacy lawsuit, highlighting the ongoing debates surrounding AI and privacy concerns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, the advancements in AI are evident. Anthropic's new AI model showcases the continuous progress being made in developing more intelligent AI systems. The introduction of RABBITS, a specialized dataset and leaderboard, provides a valuable resource for evaluating the performance of AI models in healthcare settings. These developments highlight the ongoing efforts to improve AI capabilities and their applications in various industries.

        In recent global developments, the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and policy has taken center stage. Former President Donald Trump has appointed an Indian-American as an AI advisor, sparking speculation about potential changes to the H-1B visa cap for Indian professionals, which could significantly impact the tech industry. As we look towards 2025, discussions are intensifying about how AI will reshape various aspects of society, from smartphones to broader societal implications. Notably, Microsoft and OpenAI have reached a significant agreement, stipulating that if OpenAI develops an AI capable of generating a profit of 15 trillion yen, it will be recognized as achieving general artificial intelligence (AGI). This milestone has raised questions about the definitions of AGI, with reports indicating that Microsoft and OpenAI have their own interpretations of what this achievement entails. Meanwhile, T.D. Jakes has filed a motion regarding AI-generated videos that are spreading misinformation about his connections to Diddy, highlighting the ethical concerns surrounding AI's role in media. As new laws are enacted in 2025, they will address pressing issues related to AI in entertainment and other sectors, reflecting the growing need for regulation in this rapidly evolving field. The year 2024 has been marked as a turning point where AI finally began to yield returns on investment, indicating a maturation of the technology. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools and projects, WILBY.Ai has launched ‘Simon Says,’ an AI-powered multilingual assistant designed to facilitate everyday tasks, showcasing the practical applications of AI in enhancing productivity and communication. Additionally, newly enacted laws are laying the groundwork for national development in AI, signaling a commitment to harnessing this technology for future growth and innovation.

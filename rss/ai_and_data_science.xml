        In the world today, AI is becoming increasingly prevalent, with a report stating that 90% of Indian internet users are already utilizing this technology. However, its use is not without controversy, as Tupac's estate has threatened to sue Drake over a diss track that allegedly features the late rapper's AI-generated voice. Despite this, AI holds great potential in the healthcare industry, with the goal of achieving equitable healthcare for all. Additionally, Tata Consultancy Services head suggests that AI could potentially replace call centers in the future. Recognizing its significance, the United States Army has invested nearly $50 million in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Another emerging concept is Sovereign AI, which aims to establish strategic pillars for its achievement. On the technological front, the Rabbit R1, an AI gadget, has been introduced, showcasing its capabilities. Furthermore, Nvidia-backed startup Synthesia has unveiled AI avatars that can convey human emotions. Lastly, Snowflake has launched Arctic, an open enterprise-grade large language model, demonstrating the continuous development of AI tools, products, and projects.

        In the world of AI, concerns are rising over NVIDIA's monopoly in the market and the increasing power consumption of their GPUs, according to an analyst. The sustainability of this monopoly is being questioned as it may hinder competition and innovation. Additionally, Zscaler Research has discovered a 60% increase in AI-driven phishing attacks, highlighting the growing threat of cybercrime in the AI space. On a positive note, Pico has launched machine learning and AI capabilities in their Corvil Analytics 10.0 Software Release, providing users with enhanced data analysis and insights. In a surprising turn of events, China has acquired US-restricted Nvidia AI chips for their servers, as revealed by recent tenders. This move showcases China's determination to strengthen its AI capabilities. Microsoft is also making a new push into smaller AI systems, as reported by The New York Times. This indicates a shift towards more accessible and user-friendly AI technologies. Vietnam's FPT has announced a $200 million investment in an AI factory that will utilize Nvidia chips, demonstrating the country's commitment to advancing AI technologies. In the education sector, there is a discussion about whether AI can be a solution to reduce higher education costs, with some expressing optimism about its potential. Furthermore, the question of when artificial intelligence will fully substitute human hydrographic activities is being explored in the field of hydrography. Lastly, Dr. Simon Harrer will be giving a talk on "Data Contracts as APIs for Data" at the JAX conference in Mainz in 2024, shedding light on the importance of data contracts in the AI landscape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, one notable release is the Corvil Analytics 10.0 Software by Pico, which incorporates machine learning and AI capabilities. This software update enables users to leverage advanced data analysis and gain valuable insights. Additionally, Microsoft's new push into smaller AI systems suggests the development of more accessible and user-friendly AI technologies. Vietnam's FPT's investment in an AI factory utilizing Nvidia chips showcases the country's commitment to advancing AI capabilities. These developments highlight the continuous growth and innovation in the field of AI.

        In the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the debate between MIT and Harvard as the better university for AI continues. Both institutions are renowned for their research and contributions to the field. Meanwhile, the rise of virtual models is posing a challenge to human influencers, as they face competition from these AI-generated counterparts. This development, highlighted in Barron's, raises questions about the future of influencer marketing. Another topic of discussion is the relationship between AI and Neuralink, a company co-founded by Elon Musk. While some speculate that they could be collaborators, others see them as competitors in the race to enhance human capabilities through AI. However, the use of AI aids for blind internet users is proving to be error-prone, as reported by the Financial Times. This highlights the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities in accessing and utilizing AI technology. AI's impact on politics is also becoming increasingly evident, with Bloomberg reporting on its role in deepfakes, energy, China, war, and elections. The Dallas Morning News features letters to the editor discussing various aspects of AI, including natural gas, diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, voting, immigration, and its overall influence. Furthermore, Microsoft warns that China is utilizing AI-powered social media accounts to influence the US election, as reported by the Daily Star. The Jerusalem Post addresses the challenges of antisemitism in the age of AI, emphasizing the need to address potential biases and discrimination in AI algorithms. In the realm of new tools and products, Jony Ive, former Apple designer, is working on an AI device that won't resemble a phone, according to Android Authority. This innovative approach aims to create a more humane and user-friendly AI experience. Lastly, the question of whether job applicants should be permitted to use AI in the hiring process is being explored by K&amp;L Gates, raising ethical considerations and potential biases in AI decision-making.

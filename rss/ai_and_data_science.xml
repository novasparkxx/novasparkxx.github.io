        In the world of radiology, there is a growing interest in utilizing open-source large language models. AuntMinnie Europe reports on the potential of these models to make a significant impact in the field. Meanwhile, Adalat AI has partnered with Karya to develop legal training data in Indian languages, aiming to improve access to legal resources for individuals who speak these languages. In a surprising turn of events, director Ridley Scott, known for his work on "Gladiator II," has backtracked on his previous statements about artificial intelligence (AI) being a "technical hydrogen bomb." Fox News shares his change of perspective. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called for increased electricity taxes on crypto miners and AI data centers, as reported by Decrypt. This move is seen as a way to address the environmental impact of these industries. On a legal front, the city attorney of San Francisco has taken action against websites that use AI to "undress" women, according to Cointelegraph. This lawsuit aims to protect individuals from non-consensual use of their images. Forbes ponders the future of artificial intelligence and its potential impact on various aspects of our lives.

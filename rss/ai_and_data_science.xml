TechRadar reports that the AI bloodhound is being challenged to distinguish between the two, showcasing the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, in a rather unusual turn of events, VICE reveals that an AI chatbot's "meat avatar" is running for mayor in Wyoming. This intriguing experiment blurs the lines between virtual and physical presence in politics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the business front, Infosys, a leading IT company, has introduced a new "Power Programme" for freshers, offering impressive INR 9 lakh salary packages.

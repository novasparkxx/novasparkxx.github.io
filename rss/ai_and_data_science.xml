        In recent news, the OpenAI CTO, Mo Gawdat, has made significant claims about the economic impact of generative AI. He stated that ChatGPT, an AI model developed by OpenAI, possesses an impressive IQ of 155 and a memory capacity that surpasses the entirety of human history. Gawdat further predicts that by 2024, AI solutions will emerge for deep reasoning and complex mathematical problems. However, concerns have been raised regarding the environmental impact of AI, as an article in The Guardian highlights the excessive resource consumption of ChatGPT, stating that it is depleting resources at an alarming rate. In response to the growing demand for AI, Singapore is advocating for green data centers to alleviate the strain on energy resources, as reported by CNBC. Meanwhile, Google has announced its plan to invest $2 billion in Malaysia for AI development, marking its first data center in the country, according to The Wall Street Journal. The transformative potential of generative AI is also explored in Forbes, discussing how it will reshape the roles of computer programmers and software engineers. Additionally, C3.ai's positive results indicate a rising demand for enterprise AI, as highlighted by Barron's. In the financial sector, Swift and global banks have initiated AI pilots to combat cross-border payments fraud, as reported by Yahoo Finance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, one notable development is the global debut of K2-65B, an AI model by MBZUAI that aims to redefine sustainability and performance, as announced by Edge Middle East. This project showcases the continuous innovation in the field of AI and its potential to address pressing global challenges.

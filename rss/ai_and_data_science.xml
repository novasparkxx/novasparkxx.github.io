        In the world of technology, the Singapore FinTech Festival 2024 has returned with a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Technology. This event aims to showcase the latest advancements in these fields and their impact on various industries. Meanwhile, Canva, a popular graphic design platform, has decided to restrict the use of AI for creating political posters. This move comes amidst concerns about the potential misuse of AI-generated content in the political landscape. Anastasia Bendebury, a commentator, warns that the hyper-personalization of media content due to AI could lead to a fragmentation of our shared reality, resulting in individuals living in essentially different universes. On a lighter note, AI has even made its way into the beer industry, as Artificial Intelligence is now weighing in on the creation of AI Beer. This unique fusion of technology and brewing aims to enhance the beer-making process and create new flavors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other news, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has emerged as a global leader in AI, driving innovation and future technology. The country's commitment to AI development has positioned it at the forefront of technological advancements. However, the AI revolution also comes with hidden costs to businesses. The integration of AI into supply chains and operations can lead to unforeseen challenges and expenses that need to be carefully managed. In the political realm, a Reform UK candidate has been accused of being an AI bot. This incident highlights the growing concern and confusion surrounding the use of AI in political campaigns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the realm of research, a new AI benchmark called GraCoRe has been introduced. This benchmark aims to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of AI models in graph comprehension and reasoning tasks. By evaluating AI performance in these areas, researchers can further improve the capabilities of AI systems. Lastly, Waton Securities International has launched AI-IRO, a new tool that revolutionizes investor relations management. This AI-powered platform aims to enhance communication and decision-making processes for investors, ushering in a new era of efficiency and effectiveness in the financial industry.

        In recent news, South Korea has announced plans to invest a whopping $7 billion in artificial intelligence (AI) in order to maintain its edge in the chip industry. This move comes as AI continues to boom, leading to a surge in shares for Korean power equipment producers. Basemark, a company specializing in AI-based computer vision and augmented reality (AR) experiences in cars, has also managed to raise an impressive $23.9 million in funding. However, the rise of AI has also raised concerns about job security, with executives admitting that it may lead to a reduction in human workers. In the entertainment world, the highly anticipated release of "Friday the 13th Resurrected" has been canceled due to a copyright infringement claim. On the technological front, Meta is set to unveil two smaller versions of its popular Llama 3 next week. Meanwhile, Tesla's Elon Musk has made a bold prediction, stating that AI will surpass the intelligence of the smartest human by next year. However, AI is not without its downsides, as financial scammers are now utilizing this technology to steal money. Despite these concerns, customer service leaders are recognizing the importance of investing in AI to enhance, rather than replace, their employees. In a different realm, Tony Blair's son is utilizing AI to match employers with their ideal hires, showcasing the diverse applications of this technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, Basemark's successful funding round highlights the growing interest in AI-based computer vision and AR experiences in the automotive industry. This investment will likely lead to the development of innovative technologies that enhance the driving experience and improve safety. Additionally, Meta's upcoming release of two smaller versions of the Llama 3 demonstrates the company's commitment to expanding its product line and catering to a wider range of consumers. These smaller versions may offer more affordability and accessibility, making Meta's technology more widely available. Overall, these developments showcase the continuous advancements and diverse applications of AI in various industries.

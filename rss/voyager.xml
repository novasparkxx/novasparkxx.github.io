        In recent news, it has been reported that California's two largest school districts have faced setbacks in their artificial intelligence projects. The Times of San Diego reveals that these projects were botched, although specific details were not provided. Meanwhile, Bharti, a telecommunications company, has acquired a 25% stake worth $4 billion from Altice, making it BT's largest shareholder. This acquisition will likely have significant implications for the telecommunications industry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the tech world, Apple researchers have introduced KGLens, a groundbreaking AI method designed to visualize and evaluate factual knowledge embedded in LLMs (Language Model Models). This development showcases Apple's continuous efforts to advance artificial intelligence technologies. Additionally, developers are invited to attend Gamescom 2024, where they can explore PerfDog and other top-quality assurance testing tools. These tools aim to enhance the development and testing processes in the gaming industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another noteworthy advancement is the introduction of Deep Patch Visual (DPV) SLAM, an innovative AI method for monocular visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) on a single GPU. This development, highlighted by MarkTechPost, has the potential to revolutionize various industries that rely on visual mapping and localization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shifting gears, Boston has implemented AI technology to address stop-and-go traffic issues. By utilizing AI for Good, the city aims to improve traffic flow and alleviate congestion. This initiative demonstrates the positive impact that artificial intelligence can have on urban infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other news, an entrepreneur shares their insights on selling as they reflect on building a successful company. This article provides valuable lessons and experiences for aspiring entrepreneurs and sales professionals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, there is a discussion surrounding AI coding tools and whether they pose a threat or a boon to coders. As artificial intelligence continues to advance, these tools have the potential to streamline coding processes, but they also raise concerns about job displacement and the future of coding as a profession.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for your extra section on new tools, products, or projects, here are a few notable ones:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. KGLens by Apple: A novel AI method tailored for visualizing and evaluating factual knowledge embedded in LLMs.&lt;br&gt;2. PerfDog: A top-quality assurance testing tool to be unveiled at Gamescom 2024, aimed at enhancing the gaming industry's development and testing processes.&lt;br&gt;3. Deep Patch Visual (DPV) SLAM: An innovative AI method for monocular visual SLAM on a single GPU, potentially revolutionizing industries reliant on visual mapping and localization.&lt;br&gt;4. AI for Good in Boston: Utilizing AI technology to address stop-and-go traffic, aiming to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are just a few examples of the exciting tools, products, and projects making waves in the world today.

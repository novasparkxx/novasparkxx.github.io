The conference aimed to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the growing creator economy. Meanwhile, Agentic AI, known as 'The AI Scientist,' is striving to fully automate the scientific process. However, Forbes warns about potential challenges and pitfalls that may arise. On a different note, South Korean officials discovered that Shein and Temu shoes and sandals contained toxic substances, surpassing the legal limits by 11 to 229 times. This finding raises concerns about consumer safety and product regulations.

        In recent news, schools are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help identify and spot guns, as companies continue to push lawmakers for state funds. This move comes as a response to the increasing concern over school shootings and the need for improved safety measures. By utilizing AI, schools hope to enhance their security systems and prevent potential threats. In other AI-related news, Ola Krutrim has launched its first large language model for free on the Databricks Marketplace. This development aims to provide users with access to advanced language processing capabilities. Additionally, there is speculation that AI could trigger an art revolution larger than Impressionism, as it offers new possibilities for creativity and expression. Alibaba, a leading Chinese company, is leveraging its cloud business to become a prominent investor in AI. This highlights the growing importance of AI technology in various industries. However, AI has also faced criticism, as Google came under fire when its AI refused to disclose the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust. This incident raises concerns about the potential negative consequences of AI and the need for human intervention. On a more positive note, an AI robot recently spoke at the commencement ceremony of D'Youville University, showcasing the advancements in AI technology and its potential applications. Lastly, a top analyst suggests that investing in Apple stock is a wise decision as the company's AI story is about to unfold, indicating the increasing significance of AI in the tech industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, Ola Krutrim's launch of its large language model on the Databricks Marketplace provides users with a valuable resource for advanced language processing. This tool can greatly enhance language-related tasks and improve overall efficiency. Additionally, Tsinghua University researchers have proposed ADELIE, a project aimed at enhancing information extraction using aligned large language models for human-centric tasks. This project has the potential to revolutionize information extraction processes and improve the accuracy and effectiveness of AI systems. These developments highlight the continuous advancements in AI technology and its expanding applications across various domains.

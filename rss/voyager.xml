        In the world news, a drought in Vietnam is causing a significant decrease in coffee bean production, which could lead to higher prices for lattes and other coffee products. This is concerning for coffee lovers and businesses that rely on coffee as a key ingredient. On a positive note, Capcom, the video game company, has experienced higher-than-expected profits following the successful launch of Dragon's Dogma 2. This success has boosted their expected profits and is a great achievement for the company. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools and projects, GitHub has introduced a new tool called Infra Copilot, which unleashes GitHub Copilot for Infrastructure as Code. This tool aims to assist developers in writing code for infrastructure-related tasks, making the process more efficient and streamlined. Additionally, MiHoYo, the developer of Genshin Impact, has unveiled an independent PC launcher for its gaming titles. This launcher provides a dedicated platform for players to access and enjoy MiHoYo's games on their computers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, a group of students has developed "FarmSmart," a project that aims to utilize artificial intelligence as accessible intelligence in farming. By leveraging AI technology, they hope to provide farmers with valuable insights and assistance, ultimately improving their farming practices. This initiative showcases the potential of AI in various industries, including agriculture.

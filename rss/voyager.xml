        In the world today, there are several significant developments happening in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Apple's AI strategy is being questioned as to whether it is enough to sustain the current rally, according to the Financial Times. On the other hand, Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, is building an AI empire, with OpenAI being just the first step, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy and racial discrimination arise as Houston police's AI surveillance facial technology worth $178K gets approved, as mentioned by KTRK-TV. OpenAI is expanding its lobbying team to influence regulation, as stated by the Financial Times. Additionally, 2024 is predicted to be the year when AI becomes a reality, according to Dialpad CEO, as reported by Yahoo Finance. Apple is also eyeing deals with Google and Anthropic after its collaboration with OpenAI, while Databricks is evaluating AI usage, as mentioned by The Information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, one notable development is the collaboration between Amazon and Sky to provide satellite internet in Brazil. This partnership aims to expand internet access in remote areas of the country. This initiative could potentially bridge the digital divide and bring connectivity to underserved communities. Additionally, there is a discussion on when to use unstyled component libraries instead of pre-styled UI component libraries. This highlights the importance of flexibility and customization in UI design and development. It allows developers to have more control over the visual aspects of their applications while still benefiting from the functionality provided by component libraries.

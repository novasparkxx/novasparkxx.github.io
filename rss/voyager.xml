        In recent news, A5G Networks has announced a collaboration with Red Hat to develop an AI-enabled Network-as-a-Service offering. This partnership aims to enhance the capabilities of network services by leveraging artificial intelligence technology. Meanwhile, there have been discussions on evolving safety architecture for the Digital Services Act, highlighting the need to adapt to the changing digital landscape. In a fascinating study, it has been discovered that great apes engage in playful teasing, adding to our understanding of their social behavior. However, a concerning statistic reveals that only five women have won a top mathematics prize in the past 90 years, shedding light on the gender disparity in this field. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued a warning about 'quiet' terms of service changes for AI training, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability in this domain. OpenAI's 'Sora' project faces competition from rivals such as Google and Meta, as the race to develop advanced AI technologies intensifies. The European Union's stringent AI law has implications for research and platforms like ChatGPT, as regulations aim to ensure ethical and responsible AI practices. In other news, there are intriguing books exploring the mysteries of seaweeds and stars, offering readers a chance to delve into these fascinating subjects. Lastly, a leak of Russian 'threat' information is suspected to be part of an effort to prevent US surveillance reform. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, Gathr is set to launch an upcoming initiative aimed at accelerating Gen AI innovations for enterprises.

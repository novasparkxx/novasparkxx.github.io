        In the world today, there have been several significant developments in the fields of technology and artificial intelligence. Microsoft has introduced a new Learn Plan called "Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals," aimed at strengthening individuals' knowledge in these areas. Additionally, Google DeepMind has published a groundbreaking AI paper that explores the potential of "smaller, weaker, yet better" training for LLM reasoners, suggesting that smaller AI models can outperform larger ones. However, an in-depth study has also revealed the data exposure risks associated with LLM apps like OpenAI's GPTs, highlighting the need for improved security measures. In the realm of entertainment, SAG-AFTRA, a prominent actors' union, has praised a California bill that regulates the use of AI digital replicas of deceased performers, emphasizing the importance of protecting their rights. Furthermore, a prediction has been made that two AI stocks will surpass Nvidia in value by 2029, indicating the rapid growth and potential of the AI industry. On the global stage, the United States is leading the way in AI safety, with OpenAI and Anthropic joining the National AI Institute to further advance the field. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, GitHub has introduced a Learn Plan called "Enhance Your Coding Workflow with GitHub and GitHub Copilot," offering developers an opportunity to enhance their coding skills and productivity. This initiative aims to provide valuable resources and guidance to optimize coding workflows. Additionally, Pirelli has released a strategy guide for the Italian Grand Prix, offering insights into the tactical options available for the race. This guide serves as a valuable resource for teams and fans alike, providing a comprehensive analysis of the race dynamics and potential strategies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In recent news, California lawmakers have approved legislation to ban deepfakes, protect workers, and regulate AI. This move highlights the growing concerns surrounding the misuse of AI technology and the need for comprehensive regulations to safeguard individuals and society as a whole. These developments signify the ongoing advancements and challenges in the world of technology and artificial intelligence.

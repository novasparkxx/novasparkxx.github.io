        Hey friend! There have been some interesting developments in the world recently. One news article from Ars Technica revealed that Slack users were horrified to discover that their messages were being used for AI training. This raised concerns about privacy and the ethical use of data. However, on a more positive note, Entrepreneur highlighted how Artificial Intelligence can be a powerful ally in building inclusive workplaces. It discussed how AI can help eliminate bias and promote diversity in hiring processes. In another surprising turn of events, OpenAI disbanded a team that was specifically focused on artificial intelligence risks, as reported by Port Lavaca Wave and The Business Standard. This decision has sparked discussions about the future of AI safety. On the technology front, OPPO Find X7 Ultra received an update, introducing new features such as a 25-megapixel mode and support for Ultra HDR format photos. Additionally, there was a tutorial shared on extracting words from scanned books using Python and OpenCV, which could be a useful tool for digitizing printed materials. In the financial realm, the ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF experienced a slight decrease in stock price, as reported by Defense World. However, The Motley Fool highlighted significant AI news for three tech companies, none of which were Nvidia. Lastly, Reddit made a noteworthy move by signing a data training deal with OpenAI, as mentioned by The Register. This signifies Reddit's commitment to leveraging AI technologies for data analysis and insights. Exciting times indeed!

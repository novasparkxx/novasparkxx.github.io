        In recent news, the founder of Figure has invested $10 million into an AI hardware project aimed at preventing school shootings. This initiative highlights the increasing use of artificial intelligence in addressing critical societal issues. Additionally, the market has witnessed the emergence of 'AI PCs', marking the mainstream adoption of AI technology. These AI-powered computers are expected to revolutionize various industries by enhancing computational capabilities. Another development in the AI field is the introduction of TopicGPT, a prompt-based AI framework that utilizes large language models to uncover latent topics in a text collection. This framework has the potential to enhance text analysis and understanding. Moreover, GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, has evolved with enhanced AI capabilities and ecosystem expansion. This tool assists developers in writing code more efficiently and effectively. In a rather unconventional move, a man from Wyoming attempted to make an AI mayor for the city of Cheyenne, showcasing the growing influence of AI in various domains. Furthermore, AI-controlled batteries have been developed, which can unlock an additional 10% capacity and extend battery life by 25%. This advancement has significant implications for various industries reliant on battery-powered devices. Lastly, fans of the Final Fantasy series can look forward to FANTASIAN, a new game created by the creator of Final Fantasy, which is set to release on PC and consoles later this year, showcasing the integration of AI in the gaming industry. These recent developments highlight the diverse applications and advancements in the field of artificial intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of new tools, products, or projects, the GROWI TypeScript/JavaScript SDK has been introduced. This SDK provides developers with the ability to perform CRUD operations on pages using GROWI, a collaborative wiki platform. This tool simplifies the process of managing and manipulating content within the GROWI platform, enhancing user experience and productivity.

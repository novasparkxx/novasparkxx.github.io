        In recent news, Canva, the popular graphic design platform, has announced its acquisition of Leonardo.ai, a generative AI platform. This move is expected to enhance Canva's capabilities and further improve its user experience. In sports, Manu Bhaker, an Indian shooter, finished fourth in the 25m Pistol Final at the Paris 2024 Olympics. Despite narrowly missing out on a medal, Bhaker's performance showcased her talent and determination. Meanwhile, approximately 700 officers from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) are preparing to protest over issues related to allowances and leadership. This exclusive report highlights the concerns within the organization and the need for resolution. On a positive note, India has now become a food surplus nation, contributing significantly to global food security. Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized this achievement, highlighting India's progress in ensuring food availability for its citizens and beyond. Lastly, the United States has witnessed a surge in liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to India due to a drop in prices and increasing regional demand. This development signifies the growing energy partnership between the two countries and the potential for further collaboration in the future.

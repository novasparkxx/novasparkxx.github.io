        In the world, there have been several notable events and developments. According to Motilal Oswal, DLF has reported strong operating performance in their Q1 results, and their launch pipeline has expanded. Similarly, IDFC First Bank has shown resilience in their franchise despite yearly return shortfalls, as stated by Centrum in their review of the bank's Q1 results. In the stock market, Nifty and Sensex have traded flat after reaching new highs, as mentioned in the midday market update. However, SBI Cards' Q1 results have raised concerns about asset quality, leading to a downgrade to hold by Axis Securities. On a positive note, Mahanagar Gas has experienced a 13% YoY growth in total volume, according to Prabhudas Lilladher's review of their Q1 results. Conversely, Axis Securities has downgraded Equitas SFB to hold due to asset quality headwinds that are expected to hinder growth. These updates reflect the various dynamics and challenges faced by different sectors and companies in the current economic landscape.

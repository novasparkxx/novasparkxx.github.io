        In recent global business news, Citi has reaffirmed its bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), maintaining a "Buy" rating despite the company's exposure to the Chinese market, indicating confidence in Apple's resilience and growth potential. Meanwhile, 7-Eleven has initiated discussions with ACT regarding a substantial $47 billion takeover bid, with a 'white knight' emerging in the negotiations, suggesting a significant shift in the convenience store landscape. In the realm of technology and energy, Chinese battery giant CATL is expanding its operations beyond batteries, venturing into power grids and electric vehicle platforms, highlighting a trend towards integrated energy solutions. Additionally, the political landscape is influencing mergers and acquisitions, as analysts note that both Trump and Biden administrations have exhibited similar stances on M&amp;A activities, with speculation that a potential Trump 2.0 presidency may not alter this approach. Furthermore, Apple is expected to ramp up iPhone production in India, a move that could be bolstered by a Trump victory, reflecting ongoing shifts in global manufacturing strategies. Lastly, a factbox detailing 7-Eleven's reported offer sheds light on some of the largest management buyouts to date, underscoring the dynamic nature of corporate transactions in today's market.

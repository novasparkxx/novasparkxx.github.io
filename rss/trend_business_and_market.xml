        According to Morgan Stanley, the oil market is expected to experience a surplus next year. This prediction suggests that there will be an excess supply of oil, which could potentially impact prices and market dynamics. In other news, Treasuries have seen a gain as markets begin to unwind certain "Trump trades" following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race. This development has led to a reassessment of market strategies and investments. Additionally, the CEO Caucus has urged the International Solar Alliance (ISA) to seek government funding for solar power initiatives in developing countries. This call for support aims to promote the use of renewable energy sources and address the energy needs of these nations. Lastly, Prime Minister Modi has appealed to the Opposition to eliminate negativity and bitterness in the country. This plea comes ahead of the Budget Session, emphasizing the importance of unity and cooperation in the face of challenges.

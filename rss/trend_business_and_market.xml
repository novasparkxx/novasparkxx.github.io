        In recent news, HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) has announced its plans to acquire Morpheus Data, a hybrid cloud management firm. This acquisition aims to strengthen HPE's position in the cloud computing market and enhance its capabilities in managing hybrid cloud environments. Meanwhile, the property market in the UK has seen a decline in asking prices, with a decrease of over Â£5,000 in August, according to Rightmove. This could be attributed to various factors, including the ongoing economic uncertainties and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. On a positive note, Glenmark Pharma has achieved a record high after launching an eye allergy drug in the United States. This success reflects the company's efforts in expanding its pharmaceutical offerings and catering to the needs of patients. Shifting gears to the insurance industry, Zurich, one of Europe's largest insurers, is prioritizing Gen Z by utilizing popular social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. This strategic move aims to engage with the younger generation and adapt to their preferences for digital communication. Additionally, Astra Capital Group has expressed its readiness to acquire any proprietary trading firm that shuts down. This statement highlights the group's ambition to expand its presence in the financial industry and capitalize on potential opportunities. Lastly, Apple is facing several challenges that it has not openly addressed during its April event. These undisclosed problems could potentially impact the company's future growth and require careful consideration and resolution.

        In recent global news, the tech industry is witnessing significant leadership changes, as Google's departing president for the EMEA region, a former Olympian, is making headlines not only for his professional journey but also for his morning rowing routine on the River Thames. Meanwhile, in India, EY Global Delivery Services is focusing on engaging repatriates as part of its hiring strategy, indicating a shift in workforce dynamics. In the investment sector, Lighthouse has announced a substantial $370 million Series C funding round led by KKR, aimed at accelerating its platform innovation and growth. However, the business landscape is also marred by controversy, as the U.S. has issued an arrest warrant for Indian billionaire Gautam Adani in connection with a $265 million bribery scheme, raising concerns about the stability of his backer GQG's $10 billion investment amidst ongoing investigations. This blend of innovation, strategy, and legal challenges highlights the complexities of today's global economic environment.

        In recent developments, Donald Trump Jr. has decided to step away from his involvement in the new administration, opting instead to join a venture capital firm. This move marks a significant shift in his career as he transitions from political engagement to the private sector, potentially influencing investment strategies and business ventures. Meanwhile, in the pharmaceutical industry, Pfizer is intensifying its research and development efforts in India, as highlighted by Meenakshi Nevatia, the Managing Director. This expansion reflects Pfizer's commitment to enhancing its manufacturing capabilities and innovation in the region, aiming to bolster its presence in one of the world's largest markets. Together, these events illustrate a dynamic landscape where political figures are navigating new paths and global companies are investing in emerging markets to drive growth and innovation.

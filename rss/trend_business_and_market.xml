        In a recent legal battle, Lacoste and Crocodile International found themselves at odds over the authenticity of their respective crocodile logos. The Delhi High Court was tasked with deciding which croc was the true representation of each brand. The outcome of this case will have significant implications for both companies, as their logos are iconic and closely associated with their brand identities. Meanwhile, in the financial world, the Nifty and Sensex indices experienced a positive trend, with ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and TCS leading the way. This midday market update indicates a promising outlook for investors in these companies.

        In recent news, it has been reported that Japan firms have made a significant move by offering a 5.10% pay rise, marking the largest increase in wages in the past 33 years. This development is likely to have a positive impact on the economy, as higher wages can lead to increased consumer spending and overall economic growth. Meanwhile, in Turkey, there is a glimmer of hope as inflation has eased to 71.6%. This decrease in inflation is seen as a positive sign that the country's turnaround plan is starting to yield results. It is hoped that this trend will continue, bringing stability and economic recovery to Turkey. Shifting our focus to London, the stock market has experienced a rebound, primarily driven by gains in metal miners. This surge in stock prices comes ahead of the upcoming elections, indicating investor optimism and confidence in the sector. The performance of metal miners is often seen as a barometer for the overall health of the economy, so this positive trend bodes well for the London stock market and the broader economic outlook.

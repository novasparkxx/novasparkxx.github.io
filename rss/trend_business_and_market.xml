        In recent news, a study has revealed that Eli Lilly is in competition with Novo Nordisk over the best weight loss drug. The study suggests that one of these companies has developed a drug that shows promising results in helping individuals lose weight. On a different note, a study has found that male drivers tend to take more risks while driving with a sat nav that has a 'sexy sounding' voice. This interesting finding sheds light on the influence of audio cues on driving behavior. In the business world, fuel retailers have experienced a slump in profits during the first quarter after recording record earnings in fiscal 2024. This decline raises questions about the future of the industry and its ability to sustain growth. Meanwhile, the demand for larger houses has surged, leading to a race for space in the real estate market. Many individuals are considering trading up the ladder and investing in bigger homes. Additionally, SBI Chairman Khara suggests that discouraging retail play in F&amp;O (Futures and Options) may help banks gather more deposits. This strategy aims to strengthen the banking sector and improve financial stability. Lastly, the market cap of eight out of the top ten most valued firms has slumped by Rs 1.28 lakh crore, with TCS and Infosys leading the decline. This development raises concerns about the overall performance of these companies and their impact on the economy.

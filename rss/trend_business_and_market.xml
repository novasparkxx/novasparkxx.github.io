        In the world today, there have been significant developments in the financial markets. Stocks have experienced a decline as a global selloff in artificial intelligence (AI) takes place. This has led to a rise in the value of the Japanese yen. Investors are closely monitoring these developments as they navigate the impact of AI on the market. Additionally, Nestle India has reported its first-quarter results, revealing a 6.9% increase in net profit, amounting to â‚¹746.6 crore. This positive outcome showcases the company's strong performance during this period. Looking ahead, Ashok Leyland is expected to release its first-quarter results, with analysts predicting a 10% growth in revenue. Furthermore, there is anticipation of a marginal rise in profit for the company. These upcoming results will provide further insights into the performance of the automotive industry and its potential implications for the market.

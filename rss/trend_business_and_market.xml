        Recent developments around the world highlight a mix of economic, political, and environmental issues. In India, Coal India's subsidiary, Northern Coalfields Limited (NCL), is planning to relocate a township in Madhya Pradesh to access an estimated 600 million tonnes of mineable coal, indicating a significant push towards resource extraction. Meanwhile, violence in Manipur has escalated, with four more houses of MLAs being torched as protestors attempted to storm the Chief Minister's ancestral residence, reflecting ongoing unrest in the region. On a more positive note, India's textile exports have seen a notable increase, rising by 11.6% in October, with apparel exports soaring by 35.1%, showcasing resilience in the sector. In financial news, debt mutual funds in India experienced a substantial inflow of â‚¹1.5 lakh crore in October, driven by investments in liquid schemes. However, environmental concerns persist, as the Supreme Court is set to hear a plea aimed at enforcing measures to combat pollution in Delhi. Additionally, a report suggests that the benefits of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) for India may be limited due to China's opaque trade practices. In corporate news, the Indian government has decided to wind up Vigyan Prasar, an organization established in 1989 to promote science, signaling a shift in focus. In the U.S., utility companies are urging former President Trump and Republicans to preserve tax credits related to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Lastly, Tata has reportedly finalized a deal with Pegatron to establish an iPhone manufacturing plant in Tamil Nadu, furthering India's position in the global tech supply chain, while tech investor Xavier Niel has encouraged European AI start-ups to resist the temptation to cash out, advocating for long-term growth and innovation.

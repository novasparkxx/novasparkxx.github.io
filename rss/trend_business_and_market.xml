Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management Company Ltd has been actively reshuffling its portfolio, selling 2,712 shares of Duolingo, Inc. and shares of Best Buy Co., Inc., while simultaneously increasing its stake in The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and purchasing 17,526 shares of EQT Co. Additionally, the firm has made new investments in Lamar Advertising and acquired shares of Williams-Sonoma, Inc. This reflects a strategic approach to capitalize on emerging opportunities.

        In recent global economic news, gold has experienced its worst week in over three years, primarily driven by a strong U.S. dollar and increasing expectations of interest rate cuts. This decline in gold prices reflects broader market sentiments as investors adjust their strategies. Meanwhile, in India, consumers are bracing for a potential hike in compressed natural gas (CNG) prices, which could rise by Rs 6-8 per kg, adding to the financial burden on households. In the energy sector, Gresham House Energy Storage saw its stock price dip by 1.3%, while Fury Gold Mines faced a 2.3% decline, indicating challenges within the commodities market. On a more optimistic note, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized the need for the nation to strive for excellence, urging citizens to believe in achieving the best outcomes. In the tech sector, Intel hinted at a potential turnaround, suggesting that there may be light at the end of the tunnel for the company. Additionally, the Supreme Court of India dismissed a review plea by Vedanta regarding the closure of its copper smelting plant in Thoothukudi, a decision that could have significant implications for the company and the local economy. Lastly, city gas companies are expected to face pressure on Monday due to increased risks to their profit margins, reflecting the ongoing volatility in energy markets.

        In recent news, the UK regulator has made the decision to water down the new capital regime for banks following pressure from the City. This move comes as the regulator aims to strike a balance between ensuring the stability of the banking sector and addressing concerns raised by financial institutions. The decision to relax the capital requirements is expected to provide some relief to banks, allowing them to have more flexibility in managing their finances and potentially stimulating economic growth. In other news, OB, a prominent beer maker, has announced its plans to acquire Jeju Soju as part of its strategy to expand exports. This move is seen as a strategic step towards diversifying its product portfolio and tapping into new markets. The acquisition is expected to strengthen OB's position in the global market and contribute to the growth of the Korean beer industry.

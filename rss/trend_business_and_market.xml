        Global markets experienced a significant decline as concerns over the US economy weighed on investor sentiment. In India, the Sensex and Nifty indices plunged, with IT stocks leading the decline. This drop in the Indian stock market mirrored the global trend, as the UK's FTSE 100 also hit a three-week low due to the same economic worries. The Nifty and Sensex's decline was the most significant since the August rout, reflecting the overall weakness in global stocks. Amidst this market turbulence, defence stocks such as HAL and BEL emerged as top picks for Elara Capital's Harshit Kapadia. In the international market, Robinhood, a popular trading platform, announced its plans to allow British users to lend shares for extra income, aiming to expand its international footprint. In the renewable energy sector, Minda Corporation signed a technology licensing pact with Sanco Connecting Technology to develop electric vehicle solutions. Additionally, Rama Steel shares experienced a jump in value as the company partnered with Onix Renewable for solar energy projects.

        In the world of business and finance, there have been several noteworthy developments. Firstly, it has been reported that private equity firm KKR is planning to reduce its stake in Kokusai Electric, a chip tool maker based in Japan. This move comes as part of KKR's strategy to reallocate its investments. Meanwhile, Temasek, a Singaporean investment company, has seen a modest increase in the value of its portfolio. However, it is adopting a cautious approach towards investments in China. On the stock market front, certain stocks have experienced significant rallies in July, prompting investors to consider including them in their portfolios. Shifting our focus to the energy sector, Mahanagar Gas has announced a hike in prices for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Domestic Piped Natural Gas (PNG) in Mumbai. Customers in other cities are advised to check the revised rates. In terms of sustainability, Temasek has stated that it does not rule out investing in high-carbon industries as it strives towards achieving net-zero emissions. Lastly, Renault has introduced a new feature in its cars that scores drivers based on their performance, deducting marks for certain mistakes. This initiative aims to promote safer and more responsible driving practices.

        In recent news, Zomato, the popular food delivery platform, is reportedly in talks to acquire Paytm's movies and events business. This potential acquisition could mark a significant move for Zomato as it expands its services beyond food delivery. Meanwhile, Tata Group, one of India's largest conglomerates, is said to be considering acquiring a majority stake in Vivo India, a leading smartphone brand. This move by Tata Group could further strengthen its presence in the technology sector. Additionally, Zomato has confirmed discussions with Paytm regarding the acquisition of their movies and events business, although no binding decision has been made yet. Lastly, Morgan Stanley, a global financial services firm, has highlighted the existence of an unbalanced economy with a significant gap between the haves and have-nots. They suggest that investors should approach this situation carefully and consider the implications of such an economic divide.

        In the world today, there are several significant events taking place. One of the major news stories is Apple's expected entry into the AI race. With ambitions to overtake the early leaders, Apple is set to make a mark in the field of artificial intelligence. Another development is the rising opportunity in the chemical industry, particularly for Sudarshan Chemical. ICICI Securities believes that this industry shake-up presents a fairly valued opportunity for investors. Additionally, there has been an 83% increase in equity inflows for mutual funds in May, driven by new fund offers. However, the Nifty and Sensex have experienced a decline from their record highs due to the underperformance of IT stocks and HDFC Bank. On a positive note, Adobe has announced the general availability of an AI assistant to enhance enterprise productivity. This development is expected to have a significant impact on businesses. In the energy sector, Suzlon Energy has seen the resignation of Independent Director Marc Desaedeleer, as reported by ICICI Securities. Meanwhile, Nirmal Bang suggests that growth expectations are already priced in for India Gas Companies. Shifting gears to politics, Prem Singh Tamang is set to be sworn in as the Chief Minister of Sikkim for a second term on Monday. Lastly, a KPMG report highlights the divergence on AI as one of the biggest risks to growth for organizations. This report emphasizes the importance of addressing this issue to ensure continued progress.

        Recent developments in global news have stirred significant market reactions and political implications. Following Donald Trump's victory, analysts at ICICI Securities suggest that interest rates may rise and the U.S. dollar could weaken, as the rate-cut cycle might pause. Trump's legal advisor, Rudy Giuliani, indicated that Trump is expected to take control of the Immigration Board within six months, hinting at potential policy shifts. In corporate news, Manappuram Finance reported a 2% increase in its Q2 net profit, reaching â‚¹572 crore, while GAIL's share price saw its largest jump since June after meeting profit expectations. Meanwhile, Swiggy's IPO has had a lukewarm start, with only 0.08 times subscribed on its first day, raising questions about its market reception. In sports, the NFL's Dallas Cowboys have acquired wide receiver Jonathan Mingo, adding to their roster as they prepare for the season. Additionally, Trump's win in Pennsylvania leaves him just three electoral votes away from reclaiming the White House, which has reignited interest in Tesla shares and investment strategies. Lastly, stock picks for November 2024 have been highlighted, including Cyient DLM and Lupin, as investors look for opportunities in a fluctuating market.

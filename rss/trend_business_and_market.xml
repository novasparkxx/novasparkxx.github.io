        In recent news, there is a prediction that an upcoming artificial intelligence (AI) stock split will be the next big thing in the market. This development is expected to surpass the growth of Nvidia, as one Wall Street analyst believes it has the potential to reach a staggering $4 trillion valuation within the next 12 to 18 months. Additionally, OpenAI, a prominent AI company, has successfully raised $1 billion in funding, further highlighting the increasing interest and investment in this field. In other news, Granules India, a pharmaceutical company, has received six observations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its Hyderabad plant. This development may have implications for the company's operations and future plans. Lastly, Apple's highly anticipated iPhone event is approaching, and it is speculated that the company's stock could benefit from a boost following the event. These recent developments highlight the ongoing advancements and challenges in various sectors, from AI to pharmaceuticals and technology.

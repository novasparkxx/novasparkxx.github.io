        In recent news, Malaysia's Aircraft Engineering and Maintenance Services (ADE) has experienced a significant surge in aircraft repairs due to a shortage of new planes. As the aviation industry continues to grapple with the effects of the ongoing global pandemic, the demand for air travel has decreased, leading to a decrease in new aircraft purchases. This shortage has resulted in airlines opting to repair and maintain their existing fleets rather than investing in new planes. ADE, a leading provider of aircraft repair and maintenance services in Malaysia, has witnessed a boom in their business as airlines seek to ensure the safety and efficiency of their aging aircraft. This surge in repairs has not only provided a lifeline for ADE but has also highlighted the importance of reliable maintenance services in sustaining the aviation industry during these challenging times.

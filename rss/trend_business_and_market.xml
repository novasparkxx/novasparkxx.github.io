        In the world, Adani Ports has been experiencing a healthy expansion in the scale of its operations, according to Motilal Oswal. The company has been able to maintain robust profitability, which is expected to continue. This news suggests that Adani Ports is successfully growing its business and generating strong profits. Additionally, starting from July 1, new criminal laws are set to come into effect. These laws will introduce changes such as the implementation of Zero FIR, which allows for the immediate registration of a criminal complaint, regardless of the jurisdiction. Furthermore, video evidence will now be admissible in court, providing a more comprehensive and modern approach to criminal investigations. These developments indicate a shift towards more efficient and effective legal processes.

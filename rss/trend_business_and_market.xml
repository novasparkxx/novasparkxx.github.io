        In recent developments, London stocks experienced a pullback following the release of inflation data, which has shifted investor focus towards the upcoming decisions from the Federal Reserve. This economic uncertainty has led to cautious trading as market participants await further guidance on interest rates and monetary policy. Meanwhile, in a significant legal victory for Google, the European Court has sided with the tech giant in its challenge against a hefty 1.49 billion euro antitrust fine imposed by the EU. This ruling could have broader implications for regulatory practices in the tech industry, highlighting ongoing tensions between major corporations and European regulators. As these events unfold, the global financial landscape remains dynamic, with investors closely monitoring both inflation trends and regulatory developments.

        In recent developments, Berkshire Hathaway has seen its cash reserves surge to an impressive $325 billion, largely attributed to Warren Buffett's strategic decision to sell significant stakes in Apple and Bank of America, raising questions about the implications of these moves for Wall Street. Meanwhile, in India, Union Minister Suresh Gopi has come under scrutiny for allegedly misusing an ambulance during the Thrissur Pooram festival, highlighting issues of accountability among public officials. As the political landscape shifts, Amit Shah announced that the BJP plans to implement a Uniform Civil Code in Jharkhand, though it will exclude tribal communities, stirring debate over its impact on local governance. In the realm of energy, ONGC has faced challenges, failing to secure a stake in the Deen Dayal gas field, which raises concerns about its operational strategy. Additionally, the upcoming U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions are poised to be significant market influencers this week, as analysts keep a close watch on foreign institutional investors' trading patterns. Lastly, a British engineer's bold claim of inventing a superweapon has been called into question, suggesting a possible fabrication that could have far-reaching implications for defense and technology sectors.

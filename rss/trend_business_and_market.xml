        In recent news, a study titled "What Drives Variation in the U.S. Debt-to-Output Ratio? The Dogs that Did not Bark" has shed light on the factors influencing the debt-to-output ratio in the United States. The study suggests that stability and consistency are favorable for this ratio, while any significant changes are viewed as unfavorable. This finding provides valuable insights for understanding the dynamics of the U.S. economy and its debt management. In other news, Red Cat, a prominent company, has signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire FlightWave Aerospace Systems, a leading player in the unmanned aerial systems (UAS) industry. This move is expected to strengthen Red Cat's position in the market and expand its capabilities in the UAS sector. Additionally, FlutterWave, a well-known payment solutions provider, is set to acquire a Payment Aggregator License in Mozambique. This regulatory development will enable FlutterWave to enhance its services and operations in the country, further contributing to the growth of the digital payment landscape.

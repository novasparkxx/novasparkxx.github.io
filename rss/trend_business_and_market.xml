        In recent market developments, both the Nifty and Sensex indices have reached fresh highs for the fourth consecutive session, reflecting a positive sentiment among investors. JP Morgan's Sanjay Mookim noted that bottom-up investment ideas are gaining traction, indicating a shift towards more selective stock picking in the current economic landscape. Meanwhile, ICICI Bank is focusing on a micro-market and ecosystem strategy to enhance its deposits growth, showcasing a proactive approach to banking in a competitive environment. In legal news, the Supreme Court has declined to grant a stay on the valuation exercise concerning Linde India's related party transactions, which may have implications for corporate governance and transparency. Additionally, DOMS Industries has acquired a majority stake in Uniclan Healthcare, although the stocks of both companies have remained relatively flat in trading. Overall, these developments highlight a dynamic interplay of market optimism, strategic corporate maneuvers, and ongoing legal considerations in the Indian financial landscape.

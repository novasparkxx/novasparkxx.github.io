        In the world today, there have been some significant developments. Treasury yields have slightly increased from their four-month lows as the market absorbs comments from the Federal Reserve. Investors are eagerly awaiting the release of jobs data, which is expected to provide further insight into the state of the economy. Meanwhile, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the global brewing company, has reported booming profits despite ongoing struggles in the United States. However, the company's sales in China have experienced a decline. These contrasting trends highlight the complex and dynamic nature of the global economy, where different regions face varying challenges and opportunities.

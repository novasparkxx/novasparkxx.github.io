        In the world, Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella are being considered as the dream ticket for the French far right. This political alliance has garnered attention and speculation as they aim to make a significant impact in the upcoming elections. In other news, Mitsui O.S.K Lines' Daibiru Corporation has made a substantial investment of $123.5 million in Delhi's Atrium project, marking their entry into India's real estate sector. This move highlights the growing interest of international companies in India's booming property market. Meanwhile, Alibaba's stock has been stagnant while Tencent's stock has experienced significant growth. Analysts attribute this divergence to various factors, including differences in business strategies and market sentiment. Additionally, there is news of a Croatian lighthouse and island that can be exclusively owned and enjoyed. This unique opportunity allows individuals to have a private retreat and experience the beauty of Croatia's coastal landscape. Lastly, the USD/JPY exchange rate has continued to favor the US dollar, punishing the yen with another positive week. This development reflects the ongoing strength of the US economy and investor confidence in the dollar.

        In recent financial news, GM Breweries has experienced a significant decline in its share price following a drop in net profit for the September quarter, reflecting challenges within the company. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Cabinet has proposed that the central government honor Ratan Tata with the Bharat Ratna, recognizing his immense contributions to industry and philanthropy, a sentiment echoed in a tribute from Cornell University that celebrated his legacy of transformative giving. In the pharmaceutical sector, GSK shares surged after the company reached a $2.2 billion settlement related to approximately 80,000 lawsuits concerning its Zantac product, indicating a positive market reaction to the resolution of these legal challenges. Additionally, Tesla marked a pivotal moment in its growth trajectory with the introduction of its robotaxi service, which analysts from Wedbush have described as a significant milestone for the company. Together, these developments highlight a dynamic landscape in both corporate performance and recognition of influential figures in business.

        In recent financial news, Apple Inc. has reached a record intraday high in its stock price, buoyed by optimistic outlooks from Wall Street and encouraging data regarding iPhone sales. Conversely, luxury goods giant LVMH has faced challenges, reporting weaker-than-expected sales in the third quarter, which has negatively impacted the broader luxury sector. In Hong Kong, the government has taken steps to invigorate the economy by cutting liquor duties and easing mortgage regulations. Meanwhile, Stellantis has seen its shares decline following a significant 20% drop in third-quarter shipments, attributed to ongoing inventory reductions. In the banking sector, TD Bank executives are under scrutiny for overseeing extensive money laundering activities, although no criminal charges have been filed as of now. Additionally, Indian conglomerate Adani has postponed its dollar bond sale as investor interest wanes. The Indian markets are reflecting global tech sector weaknesses, with HDFC Life experiencing gains while Trent's shares have slumped.

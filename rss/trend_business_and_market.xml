Ukrainian author Oleksandr Mykhed has recently expressed uncertainty about the amount of time we have, highlighting the unpredictability of life. Meanwhile, India has reportedly approached Apple, urging them to consider a local production plan for tablets and PCs. This move aims to boost domestic manufacturing and potentially create more job opportunities. Additionally, Occidental Petroleum stock, a favorite of renowned investor Warren Buffett, has received a boost from the policies implemented by President Trump. This development has likely led to increased investor confidence in the company.

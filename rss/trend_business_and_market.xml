        In recent news, it has been reported that the Mahindra Group, a prominent Indian conglomerate, is considering collaborating with global players to establish cell production facilities in India. The move aims to boost the country's manufacturing capabilities and contribute to the government's vision of making India a global hub for electronics production. This development comes as part of the ongoing efforts to attract foreign investments and promote the "Make in India" initiative. In another industry-related update, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has expressed its wishlist for the future, which includes the implementation of free trade agreements, simplified tax structures, and a renewed focus on tourism. These measures are expected to enhance economic growth and create a favorable business environment in the country. Additionally, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have shown confidence in the Indian market by injecting a substantial amount of Rs 11,730 crore into Indian equities last week. This positive trend can be attributed to the overall optimistic market sentiments and the potential for growth in various sectors.

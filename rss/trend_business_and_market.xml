        In recent news, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has implemented new rules aimed at curbing the issue of spam texts. While the intention behind these regulations is commendable, there are concerns that they may have an unintended impact on legitimate communication. The TRAI rules require telecom operators to implement a blockchain-based system to verify and filter out unsolicited commercial communication. However, there are fears that this system may inadvertently block important messages, such as those related to emergency services or critical notifications. This unintended consequence could potentially hinder the flow of essential information and disrupt various sectors relying on text-based communication. As the implementation of these rules progresses, it will be crucial for TRAI and telecom operators to address these concerns and ensure that the fight against spam does not compromise the accessibility of vital messages.

        In the world today, there have been several significant developments. Firstly, shares in the parent company of Royal Mail, IDS, have experienced a rise following the announcement of a Â£5.2 billion takeover deal. This news has sparked interest and optimism among investors. Additionally, Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast is reportedly considering a delay in their plans to build a $4 billion plant in the United States. A source reveals that the company is contemplating this decision, potentially impacting their expansion strategy. In political news, Diane Abbott, a prominent figure in the Labour Party, has revealed that she has been banned from standing for the party. This development has raised questions and concerns within the political landscape. Lastly, in the ongoing UK election, the issue of fair pay for junior doctors has been addressed. According to Streeting, it will be a "journey, not an event" to achieve fair compensation for these medical professionals. This statement highlights the ongoing efforts and challenges faced in addressing this important matter.
